See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'`[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files * `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files * `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files * `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files * `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files * `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages * `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence * `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files * `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription ### Plugins [](#plugins) MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: ``` markitdown --list-plugins ``` To enable plugins use: ``` markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf ``` To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`. ### Azure Document Intelligence [](#azure-document-intelligence) To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\" ``` More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) ### Python API [](#python-api) Basic usage in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins result = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\") print(result.text_content) ``` Document Intelligence conversion in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\") result = md.convert(\"test.pdf\") print(result.text_content) ``` To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\") result = md.convert(\"example.jpg\") print(result.text_content) ``` ### Docker [](#docker) ``` docker build -t markitdown:latest . docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md ``` Contributing ------------ [](#contributing) This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'`[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files * `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files * `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files * `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files * `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files * `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages * `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence * `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files * `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription ### Plugins [](#plugins) MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: ``` markitdown --list-plugins ``` To enable plugins use: ``` markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf ``` To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`. ### Azure Document Intelligence [](#azure-document-intelligence) To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\" ``` More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) ### Python API [](#python-api) Basic usage in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins result = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\") print(result.text_content) ``` Document Intelligence conversion in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\") result = md.convert(\"test.pdf\") print(result.text_content) ``` To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\") result = md.convert(\"example.jpg\") print(result.text_content) ``` ### Docker [](#docker) ``` docker build -t markitdown:latest . docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md ``` Contributing ------------ [](#contributing) This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: ``` markitdown --list-plugins ``` To enable plugins use: ``` markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf ``` To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`. ### Azure Document Intelligence [](#azure-document-intelligence) To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\" ``` More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) ### Python API [](#python-api) Basic usage in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins result = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\") print(result.text_content) ``` Document Intelligence conversion in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\") result = md.convert(\"test.pdf\") print(result.text_content) ``` To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\") result = md.convert(\"example.jpg\") print(result.text_content) ``` ### Docker [](#docker) ``` docker build -t markitdown:latest . docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md ``` Contributing ------------ [](#contributing) This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'`[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files * `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files * `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files * `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files * `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files * `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages * `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence * `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files * `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription ### Plugins [](#plugins) MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: ``` markitdown --list-plugins ``` To enable plugins use: ``` markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf ``` To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`. ### Azure Document Intelligence [](#azure-document-intelligence) To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e \"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\" ``` More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0) ### Python API [](#python-api) Basic usage in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins result = md.convert(\"test.xlsx\") print(result.text_content) ``` Document Intelligence conversion in Python: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint=\"<document_intelligence_endpoint>\") result = md.convert(\"test.pdf\") print(result.text_content) ``` To use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`: ``` from markitdown import MarkItDown from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=\"gpt-4o\") result = md.convert(\"example.jpg\") print(result.text_content) ``` ### Docker [](#docker) ``` docker build -t markitdown:latest . docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md ``` Contributing ------------ [](#contributing) This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
