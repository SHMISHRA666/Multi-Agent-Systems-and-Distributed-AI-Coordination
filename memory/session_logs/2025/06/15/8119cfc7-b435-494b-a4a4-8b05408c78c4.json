He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] ## Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019. [107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 ----- ## vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_14]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='conducted.

We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age.

Gigafactory ** In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

More generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion of solar photovoltaics. Tony Seba has highlighted that solar energy \u2013 coupled with innovative 196 Ibid. 50 ----- ## financial models \u2013 will disrupt traditional business models in respect of energy. [197] In his book on Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics. [198] He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019 [199] In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019. [200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 \u2013 as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline \u2013 more than 80 percent of the world\\\\\\'s people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.

He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] ## Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019. [107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 ----- ## vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_14]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='conducted.

Gigafactory ** In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

More generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion of solar photovoltaics. Tony Seba has highlighted that solar energy \u2013 coupled with innovative 196 Ibid. 50 ----- ## financial models \u2013 will disrupt traditional business models in respect of energy. [197] In his book on Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics. [198] He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019 [199] In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019. [200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 \u2013 as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline \u2013 more than 80 percent of the world\\'s people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.
