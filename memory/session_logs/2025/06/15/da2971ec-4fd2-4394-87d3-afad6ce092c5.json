Give details in 100 words/ web link. Yes, DLF has a business continuity plan in place including Emergency Response and Preparedness Plan (ERPP), to address any emergency situations in its operations, including both construction activities as well as operation and maintenance of its portfolio. As part of the ERPP, it has identified potential emergencies which may affect the operations and further impact the business. These emergencies are identified as natural disasters and human caused disasters such as fire incidents, gas leakage, earthquake, flood, cyclone, power blackout, terrorist attacks, bomb threats, civil unrest, food poisoning and epidemics. The Company\u2019s ERPP is designed with the following broad objectives: - To assist facilities and project sites to respond to and manage emergencies in an orderly manner; To establish a robust system for notification and escalation of an emergency to appropriate levels for emergency response measures; and - To provide resolution of an incident and minimise implications for the stakeholders arising from initial and subsequent events. Following are important features of the ERPP which help ensure safety and business continuity: - Dedicated emergency response team is available at all managed sites to address such situations and minimize any adverse impacts; - ISO 45001 aligned Safety Management System has been implemented at all managed assets and disaster management system adopted for all rental and construction sites; - Periodic emergency preparedness training and awareness generation is carried out for all employees; Robust fire safety management systems in all buildings (including early warning fire detection, automatic sprinkler system, fire suppression systems etc.); - All real estate projects are developed one level above seismic zone requirements to enhance building safety in case of earthquakes. Additionally, rainwater harvesting wells have been built to prevent flooding at site; 42 - At all construction sites, common assembly points and maps at various places have been set up, so that in case of any emergency all the engaged workers can gather immediately at the assembly point; and - Safety team is available at all construction sites for monitoring and assuring that there are no lapses in any of the safety measures. 8. \\\\x07Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard? Real estate is an energy intensive sector, with construction and operation of buildings contributing to around 40% of global GHG emissions, making energy and resource efficiency essential to business operations, building designs as well as throughout the value chain. A large percentage of emissions generated by the real estate sector arise from the value chain, including production of construction materials. However, in FY 2022-23, there has been no significant adverse impacts to the environment arising from any of the DLF\u2019s projects.\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_37]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='No. 3.

Give details in 100 words/ web link. Yes, DLF has a business continuity plan in place including Emergency Response and Preparedness Plan (ERPP), to address any emergency situations in its operations, including both construction activities as well as operation and maintenance of its portfolio. As part of the ERPP, it has identified potential emergencies which may affect the operations and further impact the business. These emergencies are identified as natural disasters and human caused disasters such as fire incidents, gas leakage, earthquake, flood, cyclone, power blackout, terrorist attacks, bomb threats, civil unrest, food poisoning and epidemics. The Company\u2019s ERPP is designed with the following broad objectives: - To assist facilities and project sites to respond to and manage emergencies in an orderly manner; To establish a robust system for notification and escalation of an emergency to appropriate levels for emergency response measures; and - To provide resolution of an incident and minimise implications for the stakeholders arising from initial and subsequent events. Following are important features of the ERPP which help ensure safety and business continuity: - Dedicated emergency response team is available at all managed sites to address such situations and minimize any adverse impacts; - ISO 45001 aligned Safety Management System has been implemented at all managed assets and disaster management system adopted for all rental and construction sites; - Periodic emergency preparedness training and awareness generation is carried out for all employees; Robust fire safety management systems in all buildings (including early warning fire detection, automatic sprinkler system, fire suppression systems etc.); - All real estate projects are developed one level above seismic zone requirements to enhance building safety in case of earthquakes. Additionally, rainwater harvesting wells have been built to prevent flooding at site; 42 - At all construction sites, common assembly points and maps at various places have been set up, so that in case of any emergency all the engaged workers can gather immediately at the assembly point; and - Safety team is available at all construction sites for monitoring and assuring that there are no lapses in any of the safety measures. 8. \\\\x07Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard? Real estate is an energy intensive sector, with construction and operation of buildings contributing to around 40% of global GHG emissions, making energy and resource efficiency essential to business operations, building designs as well as throughout the value chain. A large percentage of emissions generated by the real estate sector arise from the value chain, including production of construction materials. However, in FY 2022-23, there has been no significant adverse impacts to the environment arising from any of the DLF\u2019s projects.\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_37]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='No. 3.
