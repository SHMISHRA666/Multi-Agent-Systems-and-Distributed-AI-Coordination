The Company\u2019s objective is to create long-term sustainable value for all the stakeholders associated with its business, including investors, employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, Government and communities. To this end, it is vital for DLF to develop an understanding of the stakeholders\u2019 needs, concerns and expectations. DLF strives to achieve this through effective collaboration and regular interaction with all its key stakeholder groups. The process of stakeholder engagement at DLF is decentralized and respective departments are responsible for engaging with internal and external stakeholders associated with their functions. However, DLF\u2019s approach to stakeholder engagement is governed by its Stakeholder Engagement Policy, which provides guidelines for identifying key stakeholder groups across the organization, as those individuals, groups of individuals and/ or organisations: - that are directly or indirectly dependent on DLF\u2019s activities, its real estate portfolio or services and associated performance, or on whom DLF is dependent in order to operate; - to whom DLF has or in the future may have, legal, commercial, operational or moral responsibilities; and - who can influence or have impact on DLF\u2019s strategic or operational decision making. **2.** **List stakeholder groups identified as key for your entity and the frequency of engagement with each** **stakeholder group.** |Stakeholder Group|Whether identified as Vulnerable & Marginalized Group (Y/ N)|Channels of communication (E-mail, SMS, Newspaper, Pamphlets, Advertisement, Community Meetings, Notice Board, Website), Other|Frequency of engagement (Annually/ Half yearly/ Quarterly/ others)|Purpose and scope of engagement including key Topics and Concerns raised during such engagement| |---|---|---|---|---| |Customers|No|\u2022 E-mails \u2022 Direct customer calls \u2022 Advertisements \u2022 Press calls through empaneled channel partners \u2022 Customer satisfaction surveys \u2022 Training sessions for tenants occupying DLF\u2019s properties|Ongoing|\u2022 Product launch awareness; \u2022 Customer service delivery; \u2022 Seeking customer feedback; and \u2022 Customer query and complaint resolution.| |Investors and Shareholders|No|\u2022 Annual General Meetings \u2022 Regular interaction with investors/ shareholders through Conferences and meetings \u2022 Periodic disclosures including Quarterly presentations \u2022 Press releases and newsletters \u2022 Corporate Announcements uploaded on Stock Exchanges Websites and Company\u2019s Website \u2022 Quarterly Analyst Calls|Ongoing|\u2022 Economic performance and growth; \u2022 Shareholders awareness on business developments; \u2022 Key risks related to the Company such as competition and market risk; and \u2022 Dividend payments.| |Suppliers and Contractors|No|\u2022 E-mails \u2022 Phone calls \u2022 Meetings|Others \u2013 depending on the project requirements|\u2022 Timely delivery of material and work completion; \u2022 Enhancing the deployment of resources and manpower; \u2022 Timely payment issues (if any); \u2022 Issuing of contract amendments (if any); \u2022 EHS Performance of the contractors; and \u2022 Ensuring regulatory compliance.| 26 Content ----- |Stakeholder Group|Whether identified as Vulnerable & Marginalized Group (Y/ N)|Channels of communication (E-mail, SMS, Newspaper, Pamphlets, Advertisement, Community Meetings, Notice Board, Website), Other|Frequency of engagement (Annually/ Half yearly/ Quarterly/ others)|Purpose and scope of engagement including key Topics and Concerns raised during such engagement| |---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_22]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society.

Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip.

Tony Seba has highlighted that solar energy \u2013 coupled with innovative 196 Ibid. 50 ----- ## financial models \u2013 will disrupt traditional business models in respect of energy. [197] In his book on Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics. [198] He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019 [199] In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019. [200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 \u2013 as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline \u2013 more than 80 percent of the world\\\\\\'s people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.

The Company\u2019s objective is to create long-term sustainable value for all the stakeholders associated with its business, including investors, employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, Government and communities. To this end, it is vital for DLF to develop an understanding of the stakeholders\u2019 needs, concerns and expectations. DLF strives to achieve this through effective collaboration and regular interaction with all its key stakeholder groups. The process of stakeholder engagement at DLF is decentralized and respective departments are responsible for engaging with internal and external stakeholders associated with their functions. However, DLF\u2019s approach to stakeholder engagement is governed by its Stakeholder Engagement Policy, which provides guidelines for identifying key stakeholder groups across the organization, as those individuals, groups of individuals and/ or organisations: - that are directly or indirectly dependent on DLF\u2019s activities, its real estate portfolio or services and associated performance, or on whom DLF is dependent in order to operate; - to whom DLF has or in the future may have, legal, commercial, operational or moral responsibilities; and - who can influence or have impact on DLF\u2019s strategic or operational decision making. **2.** **List stakeholder groups identified as key for your entity and the frequency of engagement with each** **stakeholder group.** |Stakeholder Group|Whether identified as Vulnerable & Marginalized Group (Y/ N)|Channels of communication (E-mail, SMS, Newspaper, Pamphlets, Advertisement, Community Meetings, Notice Board, Website), Other|Frequency of engagement (Annually/ Half yearly/ Quarterly/ others)|Purpose and scope of engagement including key Topics and Concerns raised during such engagement| |---|---|---|---|---| |Customers|No|\u2022 E-mails \u2022 Direct customer calls \u2022 Advertisements \u2022 Press calls through empaneled channel partners \u2022 Customer satisfaction surveys \u2022 Training sessions for tenants occupying DLF\u2019s properties|Ongoing|\u2022 Product launch awareness; \u2022 Customer service delivery; \u2022 Seeking customer feedback; and \u2022 Customer query and complaint resolution.| |Investors and Shareholders|No|\u2022 Annual General Meetings \u2022 Regular interaction with investors/ shareholders through Conferences and meetings \u2022 Periodic disclosures including Quarterly presentations \u2022 Press releases and newsletters \u2022 Corporate Announcements uploaded on Stock Exchanges Websites and Company\u2019s Website \u2022 Quarterly Analyst Calls|Ongoing|\u2022 Economic performance and growth; \u2022 Shareholders awareness on business developments; \u2022 Key risks related to the Company such as competition and market risk; and \u2022 Dividend payments.| |Suppliers and Contractors|No|\u2022 E-mails \u2022 Phone calls \u2022 Meetings|Others \u2013 depending on the project requirements|\u2022 Timely delivery of material and work completion; \u2022 Enhancing the deployment of resources and manpower; \u2022 Timely payment issues (if any); \u2022 Issuing of contract amendments (if any); \u2022 EHS Performance of the contractors; and \u2022 Ensuring regulatory compliance.| 26 Content ----- |Stakeholder Group|Whether identified as Vulnerable & Marginalized Group (Y/ N)|Channels of communication (E-mail, SMS, Newspaper, Pamphlets, Advertisement, Community Meetings, Notice Board, Website), Other|Frequency of engagement (Annually/ Half yearly/ Quarterly/ others)|Purpose and scope of engagement including key Topics and Concerns raised during such engagement| |---|---|---|---|---|\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_22]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society.

Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip.
