Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.

This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD.

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD.
