Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.
