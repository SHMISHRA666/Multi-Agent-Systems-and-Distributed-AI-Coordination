Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]' annotations=None\"]",

Health and safety management system: a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Y/ N). If yes, the coverage of such system? Yes, DLF has implemented an occupational health and safety management system aligned to ISO 45001, covering entire operations. It covers the entire business including project sites, managed assets (operational premises) and the hospitality division. b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? - Incident Investigation and Risk Analysis: DLF has a well-developed group wide procedure for identification of work-related hazards, on routine and non-routine basis, as defined by its Management System Framework (MSF). Identification of safety related hazards is the responsibility at all levels of leadership in their respective areas of responsibility. The risk evaluation phase assesses the likelihood of causes and severity of consequences from the release of identified hazards against the standard HSE and Security risk threshold parameters. As part of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix is deployed across DLF which enables mitigation of risks, including health, safety, environmental and security risks, based on a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, weekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety observations are performed by trained DLF employees, construction contractors and FM Partners. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) observations arising from OHS risk assessments and audits, including reporting of leading and lagging indicators, are part of assurances and are reviewed periodically. - Health and Safety Audits: Health and safety audits are conducted for DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent agencies as per ISO 45001 standard. In addition, surprise safety performance audits are also conducted by external agency including DSS Sustainable Solutions India Private Limited and ERM India Private Limited for DLF\u2019s rental facilities. Risk assessments are reviewed on a yearly basis for any incidents reported, or based on enforcement agency, insurers or auditor\u2019s requirement, request received from the safety committee, any changes/ modifications made to the process or safety standards or legal requirement. Recommendations are Content implemented across the business units to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. c. \\\\x07Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/ N). Yes, DLF has a well-defined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for incident reporting, classification and investigation for any incidents related to health and safety. This process allows employees to report any work-related hazards and outlines the mechanism for recording and investigating an incident, recommending corrective and preventive actions and to communicate the lessons learned to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. For undertaking corrective and preventive actions, standard hierarchy of controls is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As Low As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level. Additionally, various initiatives have been undertaken to promote reporting of workrelated hazards and hazardous situations, such as: - **Safety Inspector of the Day (SIOD)** : Every day, one employee of a particular site is nominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a round of the facility\\\\n[Source: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR.pdf, ID: DLF_13072023190044_BRSR_18]' annotations=None\"]",
