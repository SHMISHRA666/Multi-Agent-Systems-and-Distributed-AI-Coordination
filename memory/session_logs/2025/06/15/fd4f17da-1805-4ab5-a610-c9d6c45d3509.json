The Company has partnership with external \\\\\\\\nexperts including DSS Sustainable Solutions India \\\\\\\\nPrivate Limited and ERM India Private Limited \\\\\\\\nto strengthen health and safety systems and \\\\\\\\nprocesses for preventing any safety incidents. \\\\\\\\nFew of the measures undertaken are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007DLF has a Health and safety management \\\\\\\\nsystem aligned with ISO 45001 standard \\\\\\\\nsupported by stringent safety protocols and \\\\\\\\nhas been awarded the Five Star Rating for \\\\\\\\nOccupational Health and Safety as per audit \\\\\\\\nconducted by the British Safety Council; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007Safety, Health and well-being programmes \\\\\\\\nand trainings are organized for entire \\\\\\\\nworkforce, contractors as well as tenants \\\\\\\\noccupying DLF\u2019s leased buildings;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007DLF has a target to ensure zero harm each \\\\\\\\nyear, i.e. zero fatalities resulting from its \\\\\\\\noperations, including both operation and \\\\\\\\nmaintenance of its portfolio and development \\\\\\\\nof its assets; and \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007Targeted action plans are implemented to \\\\\\\\ncontinually improve the performance of OHS \\\\\\\\nmanagement system.\\\\\\\\n4. \\\\\\\\t Water and Wastewater Management\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nRisk:\\\\\\\\nA growing population and irregular monsoons \\\\\\\\nhave resulted in water becoming an increasingly \\\\\\\\nscarce resource. Many Indian cities have been \\\\\\\\ndesignated as \u2018critical\u2019 or \u2018over-exploited\u2019 under \\\\\\\\nnational groundwater assessment. Portion of \\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s real estate portfolio is located in regions \\\\\\\\nthat fall under water stressed areas. Thus, efficient \\\\\\\\nwater management through conservation and \\\\\\\\nreuse is prime focus for DLF to ensure its business \\\\\\\\nsustainability, optimize operational costs as well \\\\\\\\npromote sustainable communities around DLF \\\\\\\\nproperties and townships.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMitigation Measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF applies the 4R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse \\\\\\\\n& Replenish) strategy to ensure water use \\\\\\\\nefficiency and water conservation;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nWater \\\\\\\\nrecycling \\\\\\\\nmeasures \\\\\\\\nhave \\\\\\\\nbeen \\\\\\\\nimplemented across all properties to reduce \\\\\\\\nfreshwater drawal. Rainwater harvesting \\\\\\\\nis practiced in all managed properties to \\\\\\\\nrecharge groundwater; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11\\\\\\\\n Content \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nAll rental and residential projects are designed \\\\\\\\nfor zero liquid discharge. On-site wastewater \\\\\\\\ntreatment plants have been installed in \\\\\\\\nmanaged assets, which have helped reduce \\\\\\\\nfreshwater drawal by approximately 40% \\\\\\\\nover the last few years. Treated wastewater \\\\\\\\nis used for horticulture, toilet flushing and \\\\\\\\nin cooling towers for Heating, Ventilating \\\\\\\\nand Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and Diesel \\\\\\\\nGenerator (DG) sets. Furthermore, dual \\\\\\\\npipe plumbing systems in buildings enable \\\\\\\\nthe use of recycled or treated water for \\\\\\\\nflushing; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nOther measures include installation of \\\\\\\\nhigh \\\\\\\\nefficiency \\\\\\\\nfixtures, \\\\\\\\nsensor \\\\\\\\nbased \\\\\\\\nlow-flow water taps and leak detection \\\\\\\\nsystems in washrooms and drip irrigation in \\\\\\\\ngardens, which has helped promote water \\\\\\\\nconservation; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s Rental business, achieved \u2018LEED Zero \\\\\\\\nWater\u2019 Certification for properties including \\\\\\\\nDLF Cybercity, Gurugram and DLF Cybercity, \\\\\\\\nChennai, from the USGBC, by achieving a \\\\\\\\npotable water use balance of zero. Five of DLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\nMalls have also obtained this certification.\\\\\\\\n5. \\\\\\\\nEnergy Efficiency \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nOpportunity:\\\\\\\\nIndia has witnessed a rapid growth in green \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure driven by Government led policies, \\\\\\\\nincentives and targeted initiatives. Similar trends \\\\\\\\nare observed with several international standards, \\\\\\\\nshowing inclination towards sustainable urban \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure and energy efficient buildings. \\\\\\\\nFurthermore, LEED-certified buildings are in high \\\\\\\\ndemand, attracting environmentally conscious \\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\\\\nTherefore, promotion of energy efficient buildings \\\\\\\\nis a priority for DLF to stay ahead of climate-related \\\\\\\\npolicy changes, tap into the lucrative green \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure market and maintain a competitive \\\\\\\\nedge. Furthermore, initiatives taken to address \\\\\\\\nclimate change such as LEED Certification for \\\\\\\\nits new and existing rental buildings gives DLF \\\\\\\\na platform to cater to increasing demand from \\\\\\\\nmultinational and large corporate occupiers for \\\\\\\\ntheir workspace needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMeasures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF designs its buildings to comply with LEED \\\\\\\\nGreen Building norms and has received LEED \\\\\\\\nPlatinum certification by USGBC for 40.4 million \\\\\\\\nsquare feet (msf) of its rental portfolio; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF undertakes various measures to reduce \\\\\\\\nthe carbon footprint of its portfolio through \\\\\\\\nenergy efficiency measures and adoption of \\\\\\\\nrenewable energy; and \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF has adopted onsite renewable energy \\\\\\\\ngeneration including solar and wind energy. \\\\\\\\nRooftop solar plants of 3.5 MW have been \\\\\\\\ninstalled \\\\\\\\nacross \\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\nrental \\\\\\\\nbusiness \\\\\\\\nbuildings. Wind power is used at DLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\ncommercial buildings to cater to electrical \\\\\\\\nenergy requirements.

It \\\\\\\\ncovers the entire business including project \\\\\\\\nsites, managed assets (operational premises) \\\\\\\\nand the hospitality division. \\\\\\\\nb.\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nWhat are the processes used to identify \\\\\\\\nwork-related hazards and assess risks on a \\\\\\\\nroutine and non-routine basis by the entity?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\n\u2022\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nIncident Investigation and Risk Analysis:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nDLF has a well-developed group wide \\\\\\\\nprocedure for identification of work-related \\\\\\\\nhazards, on routine and non-routine basis, \\\\\\\\nas defined by its Management System \\\\\\\\nFramework (MSF). Identification of safety \\\\\\\\nrelated hazards is the responsibility at all \\\\\\\\nlevels of leadership in their respective areas \\\\\\\\nof responsibility. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\nrisk \\\\\\\\nevaluation \\\\\\\\nphase \\\\\\\\nassesses \\\\\\\\nthe likelihood of causes and severity of \\\\\\\\nconsequences from the release of identified \\\\\\\\nhazards against the standard HSE and \\\\\\\\nSecurity risk threshold parameters. As \\\\\\\\npart of this process, a 5x5 Risk Matrix \\\\\\\\nis deployed across DLF which enables \\\\\\\\nmitigation of risks, including health, safety, \\\\\\\\nenvironmental and security risks, based \\\\\\\\non a hierarchy of controls. Furthermore, \\\\\\\\nweekly walkthroughs and scheduled safety \\\\\\\\nobservations are performed by trained DLF \\\\\\\\nemployees, construction contractors and FM \\\\\\\\nPartners. Occupational Health and Safety \\\\\\\\n(OHS) observations arising from OHS risk \\\\\\\\nassessments and audits, including reporting \\\\\\\\nof leading and lagging indicators, are part of \\\\\\\\nassurances and are reviewed periodically.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\u2022 \\\\\\\\nHealth and Safety Audits: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nHealth and safety audits are conducted \\\\\\\\nfor DLF\u2019s rental properties by independent \\\\\\\\nagencies as per ISO 45001 standard.

(Y/ N).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nYes, DLF has a well-defined Standard \\\\\\\\nOperating Procedure (SOP) for incident \\\\\\\\nreporting, classification and investigation for \\\\\\\\nany incidents related to health and safety. \\\\\\\\nThis process allows employees to report \\\\\\\\nany work-related hazards and outlines the \\\\\\\\nmechanism for recording and investigating \\\\\\\\nan incident, recommending corrective and \\\\\\\\npreventive actions and to communicate the \\\\\\\\nlessons learned to prevent recurrence of \\\\\\\\nsimilar incidents. For undertaking corrective \\\\\\\\nand preventive actions, standard hierarchy of \\\\\\\\ncontrols is followed to bring the hazard at \u2018As \\\\\\\\nLow As Reasonably Practicable\u2019 (ALARP) level.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, various initiatives have been \\\\\\\\nundertaken to promote reporting of work-\\\\\\\\nrelated hazards and hazardous situations, \\\\\\\\nsuch as: \\\\\\\\n\u2022\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nSafety Inspector of the Day (SIOD): Every \\\\\\\\nday, one employee of a particular site is \\\\\\\\nnominated as the SIOD. His duty is to take a \\\\\\\\nround of the facility and identify any hazard or \\\\\\\\nunsafe situations and submit a report to the \\\\\\\\nbuilding manager to close the findings.\\\\\\\\n\u2022\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nSafety Suggestion Scheme: This initiative \\\\\\\\nprovides opportunities to employees to \\\\\\\\ngive suggestions for improvement in safety \\\\\\\\nprocedures or report work-related hazards \\\\\\\\nand hazardous situations to make DLF a \\\\\\\\nsafer place to work.\\\\\\\\n\u2022\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nSpot the Hazard Scheme: In this scheme, \\\\\\\\nemployees report the hazards and hazardous \\\\\\\\nsituations to promote improvement in the \\\\\\\\noverall system.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nd. \\\\\\\\u0007Do the employees/ worker of the entity have \\\\\\\\naccess to non-occupational medical and \\\\\\\\nhealthcare services?

It can result in adverse \\\\\\\\nimpacts in future in the form of costs to repair and \\\\\\\\nreplace damaged assets in case of any natural \\\\\\\\ndisasters and subsequent property downtime. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMitigation Measures: \\\\\\\\nAs part of its mitigation strategy, DLF maps \\\\\\\\nphysical risks for its current portfolio and future \\\\\\\\ndevelopment projects, followed by incorporation \\\\\\\\nof physical adaptation and mitigation measures \\\\\\\\nfor assets that are identified at risk. Few of the \\\\\\\\nmeasures undertaken are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nAll DLF buildings are designed for a seismic \\\\\\\\nzone higher than the zone of the area they \\\\\\\\nare built in, to ensure greater resilience in an \\\\\\\\nearthquake. Additionally, rainwater harvesting \\\\\\\\nwells have been built for water conservation \\\\\\\\nand to prevent flooding at site; and \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nMost of DLF buildings are being designed to \\\\\\\\ncomply with LEED Green Building Certification \\\\\\\\nnorms and have received LEED Platinum \\\\\\\\ncertification by U.S. Green Building Council \\\\\\\\n(USGBC) and Sword of Honour from the British \\\\\\\\nSafety Council. In accordance with these \\\\\\\\nnorms, DLF buildings are designed to promote \\\\\\\\nefficient use of energy and resources. \\\\\\\\n3.\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nHealth and Safety\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nRisk:\\\\\\\\nDLF is engaged in construction of buildings \\\\\\\\nand management of a significant portfolio of \\\\\\\\nreal estate assets. Owing to the nature of the \\\\\\\\noperations, health and safety is identified as a \\\\\\\\npotential risk for business. As productivity can \\\\\\\\nbe adversely affected or significantly improved \\\\\\\\nbased on Occupational Health and Safety \\\\\\\\n(OHS) performance, ensuring the safety of its \\\\\\\\nemployees, contractors and the local communities \\\\\\\\nsurrounding project sites is its top-most priority. \\\\\\\\nFurther, it is a constant endeavour to provide safe \\\\\\\\nand secured facilities to all customers and tenants \\\\\\\\noccupying DLF\u2019s leased properties.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMitigation Measures:\\\\\\\\nHealth and safety is one of the key priorities for \\\\\\\\nDLF. The Company has partnership with external \\\\\\\\nexperts including DSS Sustainable Solutions India \\\\\\\\nPrivate Limited and ERM India Private Limited \\\\\\\\nto strengthen health and safety systems and \\\\\\\\nprocesses for preventing any safety incidents. \\\\\\\\nFew of the measures undertaken are:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007DLF has a Health and safety management \\\\\\\\nsystem aligned with ISO 45001 standard \\\\\\\\nsupported by stringent safety protocols and \\\\\\\\nhas been awarded the Five Star Rating for \\\\\\\\nOccupational Health and Safety as per audit \\\\\\\\nconducted by the British Safety Council; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007Safety, Health and well-being programmes \\\\\\\\nand trainings are organized for entire \\\\\\\\nworkforce, contractors as well as tenants \\\\\\\\noccupying DLF\u2019s leased buildings;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007DLF has a target to ensure zero harm each \\\\\\\\nyear, i.e. zero fatalities resulting from its \\\\\\\\noperations, including both operation and \\\\\\\\nmaintenance of its portfolio and development \\\\\\\\nof its assets; and \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u0007Targeted action plans are implemented to \\\\\\\\ncontinually improve the performance of OHS \\\\\\\\nmanagement system.\\\\\\\\n4. \\\\\\\\t Water and Wastewater Management\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nRisk:\\\\\\\\nA growing population and irregular monsoons \\\\\\\\nhave resulted in water becoming an increasingly \\\\\\\\nscarce resource. Many Indian cities have been \\\\\\\\ndesignated as \u2018critical\u2019 or \u2018over-exploited\u2019 under \\\\\\\\nnational groundwater assessment. Portion of \\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s real estate portfolio is located in regions \\\\\\\\nthat fall under water stressed areas. Thus, efficient \\\\\\\\nwater management through conservation and \\\\\\\\nreuse is prime focus for DLF to ensure its business \\\\\\\\nsustainability, optimize operational costs as well \\\\\\\\npromote sustainable communities around DLF \\\\\\\\nproperties and townships.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMitigation Measures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF applies the 4R (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse \\\\\\\\n& Replenish) strategy to ensure water use \\\\\\\\nefficiency and water conservation;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nWater \\\\\\\\nrecycling \\\\\\\\nmeasures \\\\\\\\nhave \\\\\\\\nbeen \\\\\\\\nimplemented across all properties to reduce \\\\\\\\nfreshwater drawal. Rainwater harvesting \\\\\\\\nis practiced in all managed properties to \\\\\\\\nrecharge groundwater; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 12\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n11\\\\\\\\n Content \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nAll rental and residential projects are designed \\\\\\\\nfor zero liquid discharge. On-site wastewater \\\\\\\\ntreatment plants have been installed in \\\\\\\\nmanaged assets, which have helped reduce \\\\\\\\nfreshwater drawal by approximately 40% \\\\\\\\nover the last few years. Treated wastewater \\\\\\\\nis used for horticulture, toilet flushing and \\\\\\\\nin cooling towers for Heating, Ventilating \\\\\\\\nand Air-Conditioning (HVAC) and Diesel \\\\\\\\nGenerator (DG) sets. Furthermore, dual \\\\\\\\npipe plumbing systems in buildings enable \\\\\\\\nthe use of recycled or treated water for \\\\\\\\nflushing; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nOther measures include installation of \\\\\\\\nhigh \\\\\\\\nefficiency \\\\\\\\nfixtures, \\\\\\\\nsensor \\\\\\\\nbased \\\\\\\\nlow-flow water taps and leak detection \\\\\\\\nsystems in washrooms and drip irrigation in \\\\\\\\ngardens, which has helped promote water \\\\\\\\nconservation; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s Rental business, achieved \u2018LEED Zero \\\\\\\\nWater\u2019 Certification for properties including \\\\\\\\nDLF Cybercity, Gurugram and DLF Cybercity, \\\\\\\\nChennai, from the USGBC, by achieving a \\\\\\\\npotable water use balance of zero. Five of DLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\nMalls have also obtained this certification.\\\\\\\\n5. \\\\\\\\nEnergy Efficiency \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nOpportunity:\\\\\\\\nIndia has witnessed a rapid growth in green \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure driven by Government led policies, \\\\\\\\nincentives and targeted initiatives. Similar trends \\\\\\\\nare observed with several international standards, \\\\\\\\nshowing inclination towards sustainable urban \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure and energy efficient buildings. \\\\\\\\nFurthermore, LEED-certified buildings are in high \\\\\\\\ndemand, attracting environmentally conscious \\\\\\\\ncustomers.\\\\\\\\nTherefore, promotion of energy efficient buildings \\\\\\\\nis a priority for DLF to stay ahead of climate-related \\\\\\\\npolicy changes, tap into the lucrative green \\\\\\\\ninfrastructure market and maintain a competitive \\\\\\\\nedge. Furthermore, initiatives taken to address \\\\\\\\nclimate change such as LEED Certification for \\\\\\\\nits new and existing rental buildings gives DLF \\\\\\\\na platform to cater to increasing demand from \\\\\\\\nmultinational and large corporate occupiers for \\\\\\\\ntheir workspace needs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\nMeasures:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF designs its buildings to comply with LEED \\\\\\\\nGreen Building norms and has received LEED \\\\\\\\nPlatinum certification by USGBC for 40.4 million \\\\\\\\nsquare feet (msf) of its rental portfolio; \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF undertakes various measures to reduce \\\\\\\\nthe carbon footprint of its portfolio through \\\\\\\\nenergy efficiency measures and adoption of \\\\\\\\nrenewable energy; and \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\t\u2022\\\\\\\\nDLF has adopted onsite renewable energy \\\\\\\\ngeneration including solar and wind energy. \\\\\\\\nRooftop solar plants of 3.5 MW have been \\\\\\\\ninstalled \\\\\\\\nacross \\\\\\\\nDLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\nrental \\\\\\\\nbusiness \\\\\\\\nbuildings. Wind power is used at DLF\u2019s \\\\\\\\ncommercial buildings to cater to electrical \\\\\\\\nenergy requirements.
