See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'# DELETE IMAGES **Image:** def replace_image(markdown: str) -> str: alt = match.group(1) src = match.group(2) try: caption = get_caption(src) # Attempt to delete only if src is local if not src.startswith(\"http\"): img_path = Path(src).parent / \"documents\" / src if img_path.exists(): log(\"INFO\", f\"Deleted image: {img_path}\") return f\"**{caption}**\" else: log(\"WARN\", f\"Image path does not exist\") return f\"**{caption}**\" except Exception as e: log(\"WARN\", f\"Image could not be processed: {e}\") return re.sub(r\\\\\\'!\\\\\\\\[(.*?)\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\((.*?)\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\', r\\\\\\'!\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\](\\\\\\\\2)\\\\\\', markdown) And that\u2019s how we delete images. -----\\\\n[Source: DELETE_IMAGES.pdf, ID: DELETE_IMAGES_0]\\' annotations=None', \"type='text' text='programme includes building/ asset communication, feedback sessions with individual tenants and providing feedback to tenants on efficient energy and water consumption. 3. \\\\x07Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/ discontinuation of essential services.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'# DELETE IMAGES **Image:** def replace_image(markdown: str) -> str: alt = match.group(1) src = match.group(2) try: caption = get_caption(src) # Attempt to delete only if src is local if not src.startswith(\"http\"): img_path = Path(src).parent / \"documents\" / src if img_path.exists(): log(\"INFO\", f\"Deleted image: {img_path}\") return f\"**{caption}**\" else: log(\"WARN\", f\"Image path does not exist\") return f\"**{caption}**\" except Exception as e: log(\"WARN\", f\"Image could not be processed: {e}\") return re.sub(r\\\\\\'!\\\\\\\\[(.*?)\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\\((.*?)\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\', r\\\\\\'!\\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\1\\\\\\\\](\\\\\\\\2)\\\\\\', markdown) And that\u2019s how we delete images. -----\\\\n[Source: DELETE_IMAGES.pdf, ID: DELETE_IMAGES_0]\\' annotations=None', \"type='text' text='programme includes building/ asset communication, feedback sessions with individual tenants and providing feedback to tenants on efficient energy and water consumption. 3. \\\\x07Mechanisms in place to inform consumers of any risk of disruption/ discontinuation of essential services. Any risk of disruption/ discontinuation of essential services is timely communicated to customers occupying the leased properties, through e-mail communication by the FM Teams. 4. \\\\x07Does the entity display product information on the product over and above what is mandated as per local laws? (Y/ N/ Not Applicable). If yes, provide details in brief. Products of DLF include development of residential homes and development, operation and maintenance of commercial office spaces, retail properties (Malls) and hospitality projects (Hotels and Clubs). Product related information is included in the relevant documents provided to the customers at the time of building handover or while entering into a lease agreement, which is as per the local legislation. Content In addition to this, customers are provided with a user handbook which includes information on building features and guidelines for ensuring safe and responsible usage of buildings. Furthermore, majority of its buildings have received LEED certification in \u2018Operation and Maintenance\u2019 category or \u2018Design and Construction\u2019 category by USGBC.
