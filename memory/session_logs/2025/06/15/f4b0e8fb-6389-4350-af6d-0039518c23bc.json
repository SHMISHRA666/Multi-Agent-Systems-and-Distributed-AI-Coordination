It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

[92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

[92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40. The disclosure made by Gensol in its annual report for FY 2022-23, w.r.t. this loan is given below: **Image:** Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) Rs.43,69,000/- carries\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_7]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, \u2018It is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.\u2019 [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: \u2018Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world\u2019s most 94 Joshua Gans, \u2018Intellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations\u2019, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\' annotations=None', \"type='text' text='been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology.

It is worth situating the story in the context of the growing literature on intellectual property and clean technologies. Professor Peter Menell from the University of California, Berkeley, and Sarah Tran reviewed the canon of key articles in the field in Intellectual Property, Innovation, and the Environment . [ 15] Scottish scholar Abbe Brown has edited a number of contemporary papers on intellectual property and climate change.

Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

[92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.
