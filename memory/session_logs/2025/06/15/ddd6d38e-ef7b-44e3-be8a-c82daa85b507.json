Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no manufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 25 of 29** ----- ### 83. In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to *announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers * (e4Ws)\u201d to Refex . As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a disclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was withdrawn. 84. Further, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed Exchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of Rs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US Subsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. ***Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA*** ### 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. **Prima facie violations found against the Noticees ** 87. In the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization and diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above.

SEBI received a complaint in June 2024, relating to manipulation of share price and diversion of funds from GEL and thereafter, started examining the matter. **Recent Developments** 11. Credit Rating Agencies, CARE Rating Limited (CARE) and ICRA Limited (ICRA) on March 03, 2025, and March 04, 2025, respectively, downgraded the ratings assigned by them for fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities availed by the Company, to \u201cD\u201d as delays in servicing debt obligations. 12. The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: *\u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been* *downgraded to [ICRA]D following* ***feedback received by ICRA from the company*** ***\u2019*** ***s*** ***lenders about the ongo*** ***in*** ***g delays in debt servicing*** *.

ICRA, in its statement also disclosed that \u201c certain documents shared by GEL ***with ICRA, on its debt s e r vicing track record, were apparently falsified,*** *which raises concerns on its corporate governance practices, including its * *liquidity position.\u201d * 14. On March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock exchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the Company categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by the rating agency.\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_2]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'15. SEBI called for information from the CRAs regarding the downgrade of the ratings assigned to Gensol. The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports concerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related party of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings assigned to the instruments of Gensol. 16. As per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that it was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no impact on the Company. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 4 of 29** ----- ### 17. The CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, Gensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18. CARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned to it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders. 19. However, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the issuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically denied having issued s uc h letters .

In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to *announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers * (e4Ws)\u201d to Refex . As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a disclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was withdrawn. 84. Further, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed Exchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of Rs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US Subsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. ***Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA*** ### 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. **Prima facie violations found against the Noticees ** 87. In the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization and diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above.

Credit Rating Agencies, CARE Rating Limited (CARE) and ICRA Limited (ICRA) on March 03, 2025, and March 04, 2025, respectively, downgraded the ratings assigned by them for fund-based and non-fund based credit facilities availed by the Company, to \u201cD\u201d as delays in servicing debt obligations. 12. The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: *\u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been* *downgraded to [ICRA]D following* ***feedback received by ICRA from the company*** ***\u2019*** ***s*** ***lenders about the ongo*** ***in*** ***g delays in debt servicing*** *.

On March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock exchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the Company categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by the rating agency.\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_2]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'15.

The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports concerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related party of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings assigned to the instruments of Gensol. 16. As per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that it was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no impact on the Company. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 4 of 29** ----- ### 17. The CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, Gensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol shared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated that Gensol was regular in its debt servicing. 18. CARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned to it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) purportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders. 19. However, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the issuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically denied having issued s uc h letters .
