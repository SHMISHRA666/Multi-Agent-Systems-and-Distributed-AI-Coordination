An Open Source Philosophy ** There was much excitement over Elon Musk\u2019s support for open innovation. [70] In his address, Elon Musk commented: \u2018We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla\u2019s position in this regard.\u2019 [ 71] The use of open source strategies to encourage collaboration and disseminate new technologies has a long tradition. Richard Stallman was groundbreaking in his use of free software licences to ensure that computer code was accessible. [72] Open source developers used open source licensing to support their information technology products and services. Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works. [73] Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture. As documented by Glyn Moody, the biological sciences have used open source licensing in response to the proliferation of gene patents and 70 Abby Martin, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Electric Car Patent Revolution\u2019, Breaking the Set, 13 June 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = acEi1RG2uIw&feature = youtu.be 71 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 72 Richard Stallman, https://stallman.org/ 73 Lawrence Lessig, *Code And Other Laws Of Cyberspace*, New York, NY: Basic Books, 1999; Lawrence Lessig, *The Future Of Ideas: The Fate Of The Commons In A Connected World*, New York: Random House, 2001; Lawrence Lessig, *Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology And Law To* *Lockdown Culture And Control Creativity*, New York: Penguin, 2004; and Lawrence Lessig, *Remix: Making Art* *and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy*, New York: The Penguin Press, 2008. 21 ----- ## commercial databases. [74] There has been experimentation with open source strategies in the field of medicine \u2014 such as in open drug discovery. Elon Musk\u2019s decision to adopt an open source philosophy in respect of electric cars has precedents in the area of clean technologies. In my book Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative strategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies. [75] There has been a great deal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open source strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been established to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies. [76] The UNEP is hosting the centre, and co-ordinating a network of climate innovation centres.

[21] This paper has five parts. First, it considers Tesla Motors\u2019 shifting strategies in respect of patent law, policy, and practice. Second, the paper explores Tesla Motors\u2019 embrace of an open source philosophy. Third, it analyses the larger issues about business development. Fourth, the paper examines Tesla Motors\u2019 use of trade mark law and related rights in its marketing and branding. Fifth, this paper concludes by considering Tesla Motors in light of larger initiatives in respect of clean technologies, renewable energy and climate change. Of particular note is sustainable transportation; the development of a Gigafactory; and Elon Musk\u2019s complementary work at SolarCity in promoting solar technologies. 1.

Exposed ceiling ductwork and lighting fixtures are present. ## *The Tesla Motors Patent Wall, Wikipedia * Tesla Motors has assembled a significant portfolio of patents. In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_3]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='Leaf and the BMW i3\u2014they\u2019re the constraints of technology, cost, infrastructure, and customer expectations.\u2019 [119] Oremus concluded: \u2018Best of all, if Musk\u2019s gambit works, it could pave the way for forward-thinking CEOs in other fields to take similar steps.\u2019 [120] There was recognition that Musk\u2019s position was not an entirely altruistic one. [121] Jacob Sherkow from Stanford Law School noted: \u2018Even if other competitors copy Tesla\u2019s design, Tesla still gets to sell them batteries, and that\u2019s pretty awesome.\u2019 [122] Timothy B. Lee considered the business strategy of Tesla Motors.

[126] He reflected upon the initiative: Patents have often been seen as a necessary evil required to protect innovators from having their ideas stolen. However, they can also limit the development of a new industry, keep innovation at bay, and smother technological advancement. If we are to use business as a force for good, then we should welcome competition and relax fixation on intellectual property. Very impressed by the news that electric car company, Tesla Motors have frozen their patent portfolio to help accelerate sustainable transport. In the spirit of the open source movement, the company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk announced that Tesla won\u2019t raise patent lawsuits against anyone who uses their technology in good faith. Just last week, a wall of patents was removed from the company\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters to demonstrate the message. [127] ## Branson provides a somewhat scrambled account of the nature and the role of patent law. Branson cited former The B Team CEO, Derek Handley who said: \u2018By holding on tightly to the knowledge and protection of ideas and intellectual property that is enabling this race to gain momentum, they are holding the world back from getting to where we all want it to 124 Ibid. 125 Ibid. 126 Richard Branson, \u2018Breaking Down the Patent Wall\u2019, Virgin.com, 19 June 2014, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/breaking - down - the - patent - wall 127 Ibid. 33 ----- ## be.\u2019 [128] He commented: \u2018At Virgin, we welcome competition \u2013 it challenges us to constantly innovative and\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_16]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, \u2018It is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.\u2019 [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: \u2018Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world\u2019s most 94 Joshua Gans, \u2018Intellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations\u2019, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\' annotations=None', \"type='text' text='acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

An Open Source Philosophy ** There was much excitement over Elon Musk\u2019s support for open innovation. [70] In his address, Elon Musk commented: \u2018We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla\u2019s position in this regard.\u2019 [ 71] The use of open source strategies to encourage collaboration and disseminate new technologies has a long tradition. Richard Stallman was groundbreaking in his use of free software licences to ensure that computer code was accessible. [72] Open source developers used open source licensing to support their information technology products and services. Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works. [73] Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture. As documented by Glyn Moody, the biological sciences have used open source licensing in response to the proliferation of gene patents and 70 Abby Martin, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Electric Car Patent Revolution\u2019, Breaking the Set, 13 June 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = acEi1RG2uIw&feature = youtu.be 71 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 72 Richard Stallman, https://stallman.org/ 73 Lawrence Lessig, *Code And Other Laws Of Cyberspace*, New York, NY: Basic Books, 1999; Lawrence Lessig, *The Future Of Ideas: The Fate Of The Commons In A Connected World*, New York: Random House, 2001; Lawrence Lessig, *Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology And Law To* *Lockdown Culture And Control Creativity*, New York: Penguin, 2004; and Lawrence Lessig, *Remix: Making Art* *and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy*, New York: The Penguin Press, 2008. 21 ----- ## commercial databases. [74] There has been experimentation with open source strategies in the field of medicine \u2014 such as in open drug discovery. Elon Musk\u2019s decision to adopt an open source philosophy in respect of electric cars has precedents in the area of clean technologies. In my book Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative strategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies. [75] There has been a great deal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open source strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been established to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies.

Second, the paper explores Tesla Motors\u2019 embrace of an open source philosophy. Third, it analyses the larger issues about business development. Fourth, the paper examines Tesla Motors\u2019 use of trade mark law and related rights in its marketing and branding. Fifth, this paper concludes by considering Tesla Motors in light of larger initiatives in respect of clean technologies, renewable energy and climate change.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_3]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='Leaf and the BMW i3\u2014they\u2019re the constraints of technology, cost, infrastructure, and customer expectations.\u2019 [119] Oremus concluded: \u2018Best of all, if Musk\u2019s gambit works, it could pave the way for forward-thinking CEOs in other fields to take similar steps.\u2019 [120] There was recognition that Musk\u2019s position was not an entirely altruistic one. [121] Jacob Sherkow from Stanford Law School noted: \u2018Even if other competitors copy Tesla\u2019s design, Tesla still gets to sell them batteries, and that\u2019s pretty awesome.\u2019 [122] Timothy B.

[126] He reflected upon the initiative: Patents have often been seen as a necessary evil required to protect innovators from having their ideas stolen. However, they can also limit the development of a new industry, keep innovation at bay, and smother technological advancement. If we are to use business as a force for good, then we should welcome competition and relax fixation on intellectual property. Very impressed by the news that electric car company, Tesla Motors have frozen their patent portfolio to help accelerate sustainable transport. In the spirit of the open source movement, the company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk announced that Tesla won\u2019t raise patent lawsuits against anyone who uses their technology in good faith. Just last week, a wall of patents was removed from the company\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters to demonstrate the message. [127] ## Branson provides a somewhat scrambled account of the nature and the role of patent law. Branson cited former The B Team CEO, Derek Handley who said: \u2018By holding on tightly to the knowledge and protection of ideas and intellectual property that is enabling this race to gain momentum, they are holding the world back from getting to where we all want it to 124 Ibid. 125 Ibid. 126 Richard Branson, \u2018Breaking Down the Patent Wall\u2019, Virgin.com, 19 June 2014, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/breaking - down - the - patent - wall 127 Ibid. 33 ----- ## be.\u2019 [128] He commented: \u2018At Virgin, we welcome competition \u2013 it challenges us to constantly innovative and\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_16]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\\'to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, The Zero Marginal Cost Society. [87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.
