In its annual \\\\\\\\nreport for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced \\\\\\\\nelectric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally \\\\\\\\nstructured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch \\\\\\\\nadvanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering \\\\\\\\nexpertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nWe are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the \\\\\\\\nTesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive \\\\\\\\ndesign, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered \\\\\\\\napproximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the \\\\\\\\nproduction run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the \\\\\\\\nfoundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to \\\\\\\\nenhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. 1 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric \\\\\\\\nvehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial \\\\\\\\ndesign, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019.2 Tesla \\\\\\\\nMotors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled \\\\\\\\nus to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n1  \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n\u2018Annual \\\\\\\\nReport \\\\\\\\nfor \\\\\\\\nthe \\\\\\\\nFiscal \\\\\\\\nPeriod \\\\\\\\nended \\\\\\\\nDecember \\\\\\\\n31, \\\\\\\\n2012\u2019, \\\\\\\\nhttp://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-13-96241&CIK=1318605  \\\\\\\\n2  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nsoftware engineering\u2019.3 The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with \\\\\\\\nour focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and \\\\\\\\nmanufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we \\\\\\\\ncreated through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u20194 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established \\\\\\\\na reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, \\\\\\\\nincluding information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla \\\\\\\\nMotors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAt Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all-\\\\\\\\nelectric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in \\\\\\\\nwhich electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, \\\\\\\\nstemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley.  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAt SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of rockets and spacecraft for \\\\\\\\nmissions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets\u2026 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nIn addition, Elon is the non-executive chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, which \\\\\\\\nhe helped create. SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nPrior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world\\\\\\'s leading Internet payment system, and \\\\\\\\nserved as the company\\\\\\'s Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of \\\\\\\\nInternet software to the media industry.5 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n3  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n4  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n5  \\\\\\\\nTelsa Motors, \u2018Executives: Elon Musk\u2019, http://www.teslamotors.com/executives  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nMusk has shown a particular interest in the impact of disruptive technologies upon \\\\\\\\nestablished business models. There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. \\\\\\\\nTesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity6 and the Gigafactory.7 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTraditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of \\\\\\\\nintellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely \\\\\\\\naffected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or \\\\\\\\ninfringement by third parties.\u20198 Tesla Motors warned:  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAny failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar \\\\\\\\nproducts, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our \\\\\\\\nrevenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \\\\\\\\nOur success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, \\\\\\\\nincluding know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, \\\\\\\\nintellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights \\\\\\\\nin our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing \\\\\\\\nour vehicles.9 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other \\\\\\\\nintellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n6  \\\\\\\\nSolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team  \\\\\\\\n7  \\\\\\\\nTesla Motors, \u2018Gigafactory\u2019, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory \\\\\\\\n8  \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n\u2018Annual \\\\\\\\nReport \\\\\\\\nfor \\\\\\\\nthe \\\\\\\\nFiscal \\\\\\\\nPeriod \\\\\\\\nended \\\\\\\\nDecember \\\\\\\\n31, \\\\\\\\n2012\u2019, \\\\\\\\nhttp://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-13-96241&CIK=1318605 \\\\\\\\n9  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nOn the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car \\\\\\\\nmanufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that \u2018all our patents belong to you.\u201910 He \\\\\\\\nexplained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its \\\\\\\\nintellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, \\\\\\\\nand address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nYesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no \\\\\\\\nlonger the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the \\\\\\\\nadvancement of electric vehicle technology.11 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nElon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable \\\\\\\\ntransport.\u201912 He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, \\\\\\\\nbut then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a \\\\\\\\nmanner contrary to that goal.\u201913 Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits \\\\\\\\nagainst anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u201914 This statement has \\\\\\\\nattracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address \\\\\\\\nclimate change. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n10  \\\\\\\\nElon \\\\\\\\nMusk, \\\\\\\\n\u2018All \\\\\\\\nOur \\\\\\\\nPatents \\\\\\\\nBelong \\\\\\\\nto \\\\\\\\nYou\u2019, \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n12 \\\\\\\\nJune \\\\\\\\n2014, \\\\\\\\nhttp://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you  \\\\\\\\n11  \\\\\\\\nIbid, \\\\\\\\n12  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n13  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n14  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nThis paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty, open innovation, and climate change.

In its annual report for 2012, \\\\\\\\nthe company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOur battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range \\\\\\\\ncapability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery \\\\\\\\npacks use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of \\\\\\\\nany other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the \\\\\\\\nrange capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy \\\\\\\\nefficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain \\\\\\\\nsystems and vehicle engineering.  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOur proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing \\\\\\\\nsystems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and \\\\\\\\nthe software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 9\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n9\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nperformance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted \\\\\\\\nin an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents \\\\\\\\nand more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and \\\\\\\\ninternationally in a broad range of areas. 22 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the \\\\\\\\ntechnical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop \\\\\\\\nzero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance \\\\\\\\nissues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric \\\\\\\\nvehicles\u2019.23 Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and \\\\\\\\nrecharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance \\\\\\\\nwithout compromised design or functionality. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAssessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOur success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, \\\\\\\\nincluding know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, \\\\\\\\nintellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights \\\\\\\\nin our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending \\\\\\\\npatent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad \\\\\\\\nrange of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent \\\\\\\\napplications with respect to our technology.

That is, if a technologist practiced one of Tesla\u2019s patents, would they really \\\\\\\\nbe free from liability?\u2019 Greenberg ponders whether the statements by Musk by themselves \\\\\\\\nwould be sufficient: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents\u2014though estoppel requires reasonable reliance \\\\\\\\nand this announcement is so vague that it\u2019s difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable\u2014\\\\\\\\nand Tesla isn\u2019t in the patent trolling business anyway. (Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But \\\\\\\\nwhat if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, \\\\\\\\npatents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, \\\\\\\\nIBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the \\\\\\\\nright to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The \\\\\\\\nquestions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new.

In my book Intellectual Property and Climate \\\\\\\\nChange: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative \\\\\\\\nstrategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies.75 There has been a great \\\\\\\\ndeal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open \\\\\\\\nsource strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been \\\\\\\\nestablished to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies.76 The \\\\\\\\nUNEP is hosting the centre, and co-ordinating a network of climate innovation centres. The \\\\\\\\nCreative Commons movement, along with Nike and Best Buy, helped establish \\\\\\\\nGreenXChange.77 However, this venture is no longer active.

Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very \\\\\\\\nsignificant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and \\\\\\\\nlegal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to \\\\\\\\noperate are always extremely complex.\u201981 He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \\\\\\\\n\u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will \\\\\\\\nbe motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and \\\\\\\\npatent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that \\\\\\\\ntechnology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own \\\\\\\\nR&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be \\\\\\\\ninferior or unproven technologies.\u201982 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDon Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in \\\\\\\\nrespect of clean technologies.

Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own \\\\\\\\ncompany being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the \\\\\\\\nrubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for \\\\\\\\nthe second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \\\\\\\\n\u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports.101 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it \\\\\\\\nthe oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019102 He observed that \u2018even worse from the \\\\\\\\nstandpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole \\\\\\\\nbusiness model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019103  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be \\\\\\\\ndisruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is \\\\\\\\ncheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain.  Seba noted that the electric vehicle will \\\\\\\\ndisrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n100  \\\\\\\\nTony Seba, Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley will Make Oil, \\\\\\\\nNuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Vehicles and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030, Silicon Valley, Clean \\\\\\\\nPlanet Ventures, 2014. \\\\\\\\n101  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 102. \\\\\\\\n102  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 103. \\\\\\\\n103  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 104. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 29\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n29\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nSeba was impressed by the modular design architecture of electric vehicles. He has also \\\\\\\\nemphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. \\\\\\\\nThink of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A \\\\\\\\ncar company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without \\\\\\\\nuser data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and \\\\\\\\ntechnology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and \\\\\\\\ndevelop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it \\\\\\\\nresembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle \\\\\\\\ncompanies will be on a product development  cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit \\\\\\\\nwill be on conventional linear speeds.104 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, \\\\\\\\nelectric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \\\\\\\\n\u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019105 He \\\\\\\\npredicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric \\\\\\\\nvehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019106 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology \\\\\\\\nconvergence in respect of clean technologies.

As Li-on batteries become \\\\\\\\ncheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. \\\\\\\\nThe increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in \\\\\\\\nturn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in \\\\\\\\nthese technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push \\\\\\\\nquality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing \\\\\\\\ninnovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the \\\\\\\\nclean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries \\\\\\\\ncan be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a \\\\\\\\nsource as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy \\\\\\\\ntransportation to electric transportation.109 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due \\\\\\\\nto battery costs\u2019.110 He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost \\\\\\\\ncurve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only \\\\\\\\naccelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019111 It is certainly notable that Elon \\\\\\\\nMusk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there \\\\\\\\nare indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar \\\\\\\\ncells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the \\\\\\\\ngroundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized \\\\\\\\nsolar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly \\\\\\\\nconvenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than \\\\\\\\nthe entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired \\\\\\\\nwith batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than \\\\\\\\nis consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy \\\\\\\\npotential \\\\\\\\nfrom \\\\\\\\nvarious \\\\\\\\nsources \\\\\\\\nis \\\\\\\\ndescribed \\\\\\\\nwell \\\\\\\\nin \\\\\\\\nthis \\\\\\\\nSandia \\\\\\\\npaper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nEven if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with \\\\\\\\nphotovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for \\\\\\\\nthe next 25 years. We absolutely believe that solar power can and will become the world\u2019s \\\\\\\\npredominant source of energy within our lifetimes, but there are obviously a lot of panels that have to \\\\\\\\nbe manufactured and installed in order for that to happen. The plans we are announcing today, while \\\\\\\\nsubstantial compared to current industry, are small in that context.196 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere has been much debate about whether this strategy of SolarCity will be successful. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nMore generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion \\\\\\\\nof solar photovoltaics.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

In its annual \\\\\\\\nreport for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nWe design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced \\\\\\\\nelectric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally \\\\\\\\nstructured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch \\\\\\\\nadvanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering \\\\\\\\nexpertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nWe are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the \\\\\\\\nTesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive \\\\\\\\ndesign, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered \\\\\\\\napproximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the \\\\\\\\nproduction run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the \\\\\\\\nfoundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to \\\\\\\\nenhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. 1 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric \\\\\\\\nvehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial \\\\\\\\ndesign, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019.2 Tesla \\\\\\\\nMotors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled \\\\\\\\nus to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n1  \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n\u2018Annual \\\\\\\\nReport \\\\\\\\nfor \\\\\\\\nthe \\\\\\\\nFiscal \\\\\\\\nPeriod \\\\\\\\nended \\\\\\\\nDecember \\\\\\\\n31, \\\\\\\\n2012\u2019, \\\\\\\\nhttp://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-13-96241&CIK=1318605  \\\\\\\\n2  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 3\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nsoftware engineering\u2019.3 The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with \\\\\\\\nour focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and \\\\\\\\nmanufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we \\\\\\\\ncreated through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u20194 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established \\\\\\\\na reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, \\\\\\\\nincluding information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla \\\\\\\\nMotors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAt Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all-\\\\\\\\nelectric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in \\\\\\\\nwhich electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, \\\\\\\\nstemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley.  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAt SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of rockets and spacecraft for \\\\\\\\nmissions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets\u2026 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nIn addition, Elon is the non-executive chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, which \\\\\\\\nhe helped create. SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nPrior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world\\\\\\'s leading Internet payment system, and \\\\\\\\nserved as the company\\\\\\'s Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of \\\\\\\\nInternet software to the media industry.5 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n3  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n4  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n5  \\\\\\\\nTelsa Motors, \u2018Executives: Elon Musk\u2019, http://www.teslamotors.com/executives  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 4\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nMusk has shown a particular interest in the impact of disruptive technologies upon \\\\\\\\nestablished business models. There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. \\\\\\\\nTesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity6 and the Gigafactory.7 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTraditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of \\\\\\\\nintellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely \\\\\\\\naffected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or \\\\\\\\ninfringement by third parties.\u20198 Tesla Motors warned:  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nAny failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar \\\\\\\\nproducts, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our \\\\\\\\nrevenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \\\\\\\\nOur success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, \\\\\\\\nincluding know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, \\\\\\\\nintellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights \\\\\\\\nin our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing \\\\\\\\nour vehicles.9 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other \\\\\\\\nintellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n6  \\\\\\\\nSolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team  \\\\\\\\n7  \\\\\\\\nTesla Motors, \u2018Gigafactory\u2019, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory \\\\\\\\n8  \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n\u2018Annual \\\\\\\\nReport \\\\\\\\nfor \\\\\\\\nthe \\\\\\\\nFiscal \\\\\\\\nPeriod \\\\\\\\nended \\\\\\\\nDecember \\\\\\\\n31, \\\\\\\\n2012\u2019, \\\\\\\\nhttp://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-13-96241&CIK=1318605 \\\\\\\\n9  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 5\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nOn the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car \\\\\\\\nmanufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that \u2018all our patents belong to you.\u201910 He \\\\\\\\nexplained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its \\\\\\\\nintellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, \\\\\\\\nand address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nYesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no \\\\\\\\nlonger the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the \\\\\\\\nadvancement of electric vehicle technology.11 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nElon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable \\\\\\\\ntransport.\u201912 He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, \\\\\\\\nbut then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a \\\\\\\\nmanner contrary to that goal.\u201913 Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits \\\\\\\\nagainst anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u201914 This statement has \\\\\\\\nattracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address \\\\\\\\nclimate change. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n10  \\\\\\\\nElon \\\\\\\\nMusk, \\\\\\\\n\u2018All \\\\\\\\nOur \\\\\\\\nPatents \\\\\\\\nBelong \\\\\\\\nto \\\\\\\\nYou\u2019, \\\\\\\\nTesla \\\\\\\\nMotors, \\\\\\\\n12 \\\\\\\\nJune \\\\\\\\n2014, \\\\\\\\nhttp://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you  \\\\\\\\n11  \\\\\\\\nIbid, \\\\\\\\n12  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n13  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n14  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 6\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n6\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nThis paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual \\\\\\\\nproperty, open innovation, and climate change.

In its annual report for 2012, \\\\\\\\nthe company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nOur battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range \\\\\\\\ncapability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery \\\\\\\\npacks use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of \\\\\\\\nany other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the \\\\\\\\nrange capabilities of our vehicles.

To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, \\\\\\\\nincluding know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, \\\\\\\\nintellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights \\\\\\\\nin our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending \\\\\\\\npatent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad \\\\\\\\nrange of areas.

That is, if a technologist practiced one of Tesla\u2019s patents, would they really \\\\\\\\nbe free from liability?\u2019 Greenberg ponders whether the statements by Musk by themselves \\\\\\\\nwould be sufficient: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents\u2014though estoppel requires reasonable reliance \\\\\\\\nand this announcement is so vague that it\u2019s difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable\u2014\\\\\\\\nand Tesla isn\u2019t in the patent trolling business anyway. (Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But \\\\\\\\nwhat if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, \\\\\\\\npatents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nTesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, \\\\\\\\nIBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the \\\\\\\\nright to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The \\\\\\\\nquestions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will \\\\\\\\nhave to answer them.59 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere has been similar issues arising in the context of battles over gene patents \u2013 there has \\\\\\\\nbeen much discussion as to whether Genetic Technologies Limited would be estopped from \\\\\\\\ntaking action, in light of its statements.60 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n58  \\\\\\\\nBrad Greenberg, \u2018Tesla Encourages Free Use of its Patents \u2013 But Will that Protect Users from \\\\\\\\nLiability?\u2019, Concurring Opinions, 13 June 2014, http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2014/06/tesla-\\\\\\\\nencourages-free-use-of-its-patents-but-will-that-protect-users-from-liability.html  \\\\\\\\n59  \\\\\\\\nIbid. \\\\\\\\n60  \\\\\\\\nSee Matthew Rimmer, \\\\\\'The Alchemy of Junk:  Patent Law and Non-Coding DNA\\\\\\' (2006) 3 (2) The \\\\\\\\nUniversity of Ottawa Law and Technology Journal 539-599. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 19\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n19\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nThe decision of Tesla Motors has been a fillip for the patent reform movement. Julie Samuels \\\\\\\\nof the public policy think thank, Engine, commented: \u2018What you\u2019re looking at here is the \\\\\\\\nbeginning of a new culture with regard to patents.\u201961 She observed: \u2018A lot of companies in the \\\\\\\\nhigh tech space are dismayed with how the system is shaping up, so they\u2019re trying to come up \\\\\\\\nwith creative ways to navigating around that system and get back to the business of \\\\\\\\ninnovating and creating.\u201962 The announcement of Tesla Motors may help provide impetus for \\\\\\\\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to address the problem of patent trolls and reduce patent \\\\\\\\nlitigation. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSome members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the \\\\\\\\npatent regime in light of Elon Musk\u2019s comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful \\\\\\\\nriposte.63 He observed: \u2018While this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this \\\\\\\\nthought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is \\\\\\\\nonly a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.\u201964 Totaro responded: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nPatents are not just about hitting the \u2018litigation lottery\u2019 as Mr. Musk put it.

In my book Intellectual Property and Climate \\\\\\\\nChange: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative \\\\\\\\nstrategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies.75 There has been a great \\\\\\\\ndeal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open \\\\\\\\nsource strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been \\\\\\\\nestablished to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies.76 The \\\\\\\\nUNEP is hosting the centre, and co-ordinating a network of climate innovation centres. The \\\\\\\\nCreative Commons movement, along with Nike and Best Buy, helped establish \\\\\\\\nGreenXChange.77 However, this venture is no longer active.

Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very \\\\\\\\nsignificant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and \\\\\\\\nlegal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to \\\\\\\\noperate are always extremely complex.\u201981 He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \\\\\\\\n\u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will \\\\\\\\nbe motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and \\\\\\\\npatent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that \\\\\\\\ntechnology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own \\\\\\\\nR&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be \\\\\\\\ninferior or unproven technologies.\u201982 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nDon Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in \\\\\\\\nrespect of clean technologies.

Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own \\\\\\\\ncompany being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the \\\\\\\\nrubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for \\\\\\\\nthe second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \\\\\\\\n\u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports.101 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it \\\\\\\\nthe oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019102 He observed that \u2018even worse from the \\\\\\\\nstandpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole \\\\\\\\nbusiness model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019103  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be \\\\\\\\ndisruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is \\\\\\\\ncheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain.  Seba noted that the electric vehicle will \\\\\\\\ndisrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. \\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n100  \\\\\\\\nTony Seba, Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley will Make Oil, \\\\\\\\nNuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Vehicles and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030, Silicon Valley, Clean \\\\\\\\nPlanet Ventures, 2014. \\\\\\\\n101  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 102. \\\\\\\\n102  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 103. \\\\\\\\n103  \\\\\\\\nIbid., 104. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 29\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n29\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\n\\\\xa0\\\\\\\\nSeba was impressed by the modular design architecture of electric vehicles. He has also \\\\\\\\nemphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. \\\\\\\\nThink of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A \\\\\\\\ncar company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without \\\\\\\\nuser data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and \\\\\\\\ntechnology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and \\\\\\\\ndevelop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it \\\\\\\\nresembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle \\\\\\\\ncompanies will be on a product development  cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit \\\\\\\\nwill be on conventional linear speeds.104 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, \\\\\\\\nelectric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \\\\\\\\n\u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019105 He \\\\\\\\npredicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric \\\\\\\\nvehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019106 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology \\\\\\\\nconvergence in respect of clean technologies.

As Li-on batteries become \\\\\\\\ncheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. \\\\\\\\nThe increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in \\\\\\\\nturn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThe increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in \\\\\\\\nthese technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push \\\\\\\\nquality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing \\\\\\\\ninnovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the \\\\\\\\nclean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries \\\\\\\\ncan be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a \\\\\\\\nsource as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy \\\\\\\\ntransportation to electric transportation.109 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSeba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due \\\\\\\\nto battery costs\u2019.110 He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost \\\\\\\\ncurve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only \\\\\\\\naccelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019111 It is certainly notable that Elon \\\\\\\\nMusk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there \\\\\\\\nare indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar \\\\\\\\ncells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the \\\\\\\\ngroundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized \\\\\\\\nsolar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nSolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly \\\\\\\\nconvenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than \\\\\\\\nthe entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired \\\\\\\\nwith batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than \\\\\\\\nis consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy \\\\\\\\npotential \\\\\\\\nfrom \\\\\\\\nvarious \\\\\\\\nsources \\\\\\\\nis \\\\\\\\ndescribed \\\\\\\\nwell \\\\\\\\nin \\\\\\\\nthis \\\\\\\\nSandia \\\\\\\\npaper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nEven if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with \\\\\\\\nphotovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for \\\\\\\\nthe next 25 years. We absolutely believe that solar power can and will become the world\u2019s \\\\\\\\npredominant source of energy within our lifetimes, but there are obviously a lot of panels that have to \\\\\\\\nbe manufactured and installed in order for that to happen. The plans we are announcing today, while \\\\\\\\nsubstantial compared to current industry, are small in that context.196 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nThere has been much debate about whether this strategy of SolarCity will be successful. \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nMore generally, there has been a great optimism about the widespread adoption and diffusion \\\\\\\\nof solar photovoltaics.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

[49] Moreover, the company asked that \u2018Tesla be awarded such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\u2019 [50] Such disputes are not uncommon. In my 2011 book Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies, I considered the significant patent litigation in respect of green cars and transportation. [51] There was an epic dispute between Paice LLC and Toyota Motors over patents regarding hybrid cars, such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Motors was indignant at the litigation, calling its opponent a \u2018patent shark\u2019. However, the company fared poorly in the long-winded litigation.

[7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_3]' annotations=None\", 'type=\\'text\\' text=\"Ibid. 25 Maulin Shah, \u2018Auto Industry May Ignore Tesla\u2019s Patents\u2019, Enivsion IP, 26 June 2014, http://envisionip.com/blog/2014/06/26/auto - industry - may - ignore - tesla - patents/ 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 10 ----- **Image:** Here\\'s the text from the image: TESLA PATENT INOGRAPHIC DELTIGHT.COM \u2756 ENVISIONIP.COM 172 ISSUED PATENTS 123 PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS BATTERY & CHARGING 28 PATENTS 18 APPLICATIONS MOTOR & DRIVE CONTROL 24 PATENTS 15 APPLICATIONS FRAME & CHASSIS 16 PATENTS 10 APPLICATIONS DOORS & LATCHES 13 PATENTS 9 APPLICATIONS HVAC 11 PATENTS 7 APPLICATIONS MISCELLANEOUS 9 PATENTS 4 APPLICATIONS SUNROOF 6 PATENTS 3 APPLICATIONS USER INTERFACE & MULTIMEDIA 5 PATENTS 2 APPLICATIONS DESIGN 4 PATENTS 1 APPLICATIONS ACTIVITY OVER TIME PATENT PUBLICATIONS PER YEAR 2005 0 2 4 9 35 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 36 2012 61 2013 109 2014 39 FOUNDER AND TOP INVENTORS BY NUMBER OF PATENTS TAHO YIFAN 16 KURT RUSSELL HELTS 20 WESTON ARTHUR HERMAN 13 FRANCISCO LEPORT 12 ELON MUSK (FOUNDER) 3 PETER DORE RUNNISON 15 11 ----- **Image:** PATENTS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY MAJOR AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS GM 686 TOYOTA 663 HONDA 662 FORD 466 NISSAN 238 DAIMLER 194 HYUNDAI 109 BMW 41 KIA 27 MAZDA 24 AN INFOGRAPHIC BY DELTASIGHT.COM & ENVISIONIP.COM ## The company emphasized that \u2018the protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities.\u2019 [28] However, Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons.\u2019 [29] The company was conscious that \u2018our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights.\u2019 Tesla Motors recognised that \u2018the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual 28 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 ----- ## property rights or for other reasons.\u2019 [30] The company also noted that \u2018the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.\u2019 [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that \u2018current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.\u2019 [32] Tesla Motors admitted that \u2018The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain\u2019. [33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_5]\" annotations=None']",
