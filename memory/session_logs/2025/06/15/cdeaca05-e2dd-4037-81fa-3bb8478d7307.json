GEL, in its latest public \\\\\\\\ndisclosures as well as in its recent communications with ICRA, had highlighted sizeable \\\\\\\\navailable liquidity to support its operations during its ongoing growth phase.\u201d \\\\\\\\n13. \\\\\\\\nICRA, in its statement also disclosed that \u201ccertain documents shared by GEL \\\\\\\\nwith ICRA, on its debt servicing track record, were apparently falsified, \\\\\\\\nwhich raises concerns on its corporate governance practices, including its \\\\\\\\nliquidity position.\u201d \\\\\\\\n14. \\\\\\\\nOn March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock \\\\\\\\nexchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the \\\\\\\\nCompany categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by \\\\\\\\nthe rating agency. \\\\\\\\n15. \\\\\\\\nSEBI called for information from the CRAs regarding the downgrade of the \\\\\\\\nratings assigned to Gensol. The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports \\\\\\\\nconcerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related \\\\\\\\nparty of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings \\\\\\\\nassigned to the instruments of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n16. \\\\\\\\nAs per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that \\\\\\\\nit was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no \\\\\\\\nimpact on the Company. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 5 of 29 \\\\\\\\n17. \\\\\\\\nThe CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, \\\\\\\\nGensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian \\\\\\\\nRenewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance \\\\\\\\nCorporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol \\\\\\\\nshared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated \\\\\\\\nthat Gensol was regular in its debt servicing.  \\\\\\\\n18. \\\\\\\\nCARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned \\\\\\\\nto it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) \\\\\\\\npurportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders.  \\\\\\\\n19. \\\\\\\\nHowever, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the \\\\\\\\nissuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically \\\\\\\\ndenied having issued such letters. Images of the conduct letters purportedly \\\\\\\\nissued by IREDA and PFC and submitted by Gensol to the CRAs are provided \\\\\\\\nbelow: \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 8\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 6 of 29 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n20. \\\\\\\\nSEBI subsequently called for detailed information from IREDA and PFC \\\\\\\\nregarding the debt servicing status of loans sanctioned to Gensol along with the \\\\\\\\nloan sanction letters and account statements. On reviewing the information \\\\\\\\nsubmitted by the aforesaid lenders, multiple instances of default by the \\\\\\\\nCompany in servicing their loans were observed, the details of which are given \\\\\\\\nin the table below: \\\\\\\\nSl.

The Company however continued to submit statements \\\\\\\\nto the CRAs certifying there was no delay or default in servicing any loans (No \\\\\\\\nDefault Statements). The statements for December 2024, January 2025 and \\\\\\\\nFebruary 2025 were submitted on January 6, 2025, February 10, 2025 and \\\\\\\\nMarch 3, 2025, respectively.

As per the submissions made by Gensol, EVs were procured by the \\\\\\\\nCompany and subsequently leased to BluSmart, a related party.  \\\\\\\\n26. \\\\\\\\nGensol, vide its response dated February 14, 2025, acknowledged that it had \\\\\\\\nprocured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) till date, as against the 6,400 EVs \\\\\\\\nfor which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto \\\\\\\\nPrivate Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that \\\\\\\\nit sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore.  \\\\\\\\n27. \\\\\\\\nHowever, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. \\\\\\\\n663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to \\\\\\\\nprovide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total \\\\\\\\nexpected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of \\\\\\\\n6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore \\\\\\\\n(Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though \\\\\\\\nmore than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the \\\\\\\\nabove mentioned financing.  \\\\\\\\n28. \\\\\\\\nGiven the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both \\\\\\\\nthe Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed \\\\\\\\nthat once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the \\\\\\\\npurchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to \\\\\\\\nthe Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to \\\\\\\\nAnmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n29. \\\\\\\\nSome of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the \\\\\\\\npurpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal \\\\\\\\nexpenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) \\\\\\\\nbenefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close \\\\\\\\nrelatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these \\\\\\\\ndiversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and \\\\\\\\nthereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 11\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 9 of 29 \\\\\\\\nthe above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 \\\\\\\\nin the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. \\\\\\\\n30. \\\\\\\\nFor ease of reference, the details of the related parties to which fund transfers \\\\\\\\nwere observed from Go-Auto are detailed in the Table below, before explaining \\\\\\\\nthe nature of transactions entered with these entities.  \\\\\\\\nSl. \\\\\\\\nNo \\\\\\\\nRelated or Connected \\\\\\\\nentities \\\\\\\\nRelationship \\\\\\\\nDisclosed by the \\\\\\\\nCompany \\\\\\\\nas \\\\\\\\nRelated party \\\\\\\\n1. \\\\\\\\n Capbridge \\\\\\\\nVentures \\\\\\\\nLLP (Capbridge) \\\\\\\\nAnmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi are designated partners of \\\\\\\\nCapbridge. \\\\\\\\nYes \\\\\\\\n2. \\\\\\\\n Matrix \\\\\\\\nGas \\\\\\\\nand \\\\\\\\nRenewable Ltd.

As per information provided by DLF (email dated \\\\\\\\nDecember 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for \\\\\\\\nthe purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias. The submissions \\\\\\\\nmade by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: \\\\\\\\n(a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by \\\\\\\\nJasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The \\\\\\\\nCamellias. \\\\\\\\n(b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the \\\\\\\\nconsideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. \\\\\\\\n(c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. \\\\\\\\n(d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. \\\\\\\\n(e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on \\\\\\\\nNovember 21, 2022. \\\\\\\\n35. \\\\\\\\nA pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 11 of 29 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n36. \\\\\\\\nIt can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for \\\\\\\\nprocuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a \\\\\\\\nhigh-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm \\\\\\\\nwhere the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. \\\\\\\\n37. \\\\\\\\nIt was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking \\\\\\\\nadvance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced \\\\\\\\nfrom Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to \\\\\\\\nJasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead \\\\\\\\ncredited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables \\\\\\\\nLtd. (Matrix).

Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore \\\\\\\\nout of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., \\\\\\\\n(a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi. This aspect need further examination.  \\\\\\\\n54. \\\\\\\\nFrom the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol \\\\\\\\nfrom IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis-\\\\\\\\nutilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related \\\\\\\\nentities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore \\\\\\\\n(including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis \\\\\\\\nshowed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has \\\\\\\\nobtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore.  \\\\\\\\n55. \\\\\\\\nAjay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before \\\\\\\\nSEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was \\\\\\\\ndue from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs \\\\\\\\nto Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n56. \\\\\\\\nIn this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated \\\\\\\\nApril 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore \\\\\\\\nas interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the \\\\\\\\nsame letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a \\\\\\\\npayable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. \\\\\\\\n57. \\\\\\\\nFrom the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that \\\\\\\\neven after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) \\\\\\\\nover and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to \\\\\\\\nGensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as \\\\\\\\nper the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie \\\\\\\\nappears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto \\\\\\\\nas a conduit, which needs detailed investigation.  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 20\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 18 of 29 \\\\\\\\nDiversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\n58. \\\\\\\\nAs stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money \\\\\\\\nborrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto. \\\\\\\\nIt was further noted during the examination that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet \\\\\\\\nSingh Jaggi\u2014current promoters and directors of Gensol\u2014were also directors \\\\\\\\nin Wellray until April 15, 2020. Further, up to the financial year 2019\u201320, the \\\\\\\\nentire shareholding in Wellray was held by Puneet Singh Jaggi and Gensol \\\\\\\\nVentures Private Limited \u2013both promoters of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n59. \\\\\\\\nPresently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit \\\\\\\\nSolanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol \\\\\\\\nGroup until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn. Given \\\\\\\\nthe same, it is prima facie observed that Wellray is connected to Gensol, both \\\\\\\\nthrough historical promoter positions and current key managerial associations. \\\\\\\\n60. \\\\\\\\nWhen the ledgers of Wellray in the books of Gensol were examined, it was \\\\\\\\nnoted that significant sales and purchases were recorded between both \\\\\\\\ncompanies in FY 23 and FY24, the details of which are given in the Table below: \\\\\\\\nParticulars \\\\\\\\nFY 23 \\\\\\\\n(Rs.

As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of \\\\\\\\nGensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions.  \\\\\\\\nDisclosures made by the Company \\\\\\\\n80. \\\\\\\\nIt was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, \\\\\\\\nto the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly \\\\\\\\nlaunched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. \\\\\\\\nHowever, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and \\\\\\\\nexamined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of \\\\\\\\nUnderstandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs \\\\\\\\nwere in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price \\\\\\\\nof the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the \\\\\\\\nCompany was making misleading disclosures to investors.  \\\\\\\\n81. \\\\\\\\nIn this regard, representative of NSE visited the plant site of Gensol Electric \\\\\\\\nVehicle Private Limited located at Gat No. 877, Next to Mahindra Towers, Khed, \\\\\\\\nNighoje, Chakan, Pune \u2013 410501 on April 09, 2025.  \\\\\\\\n82. \\\\\\\\nIt was found during the visit that there was no manufacturing activity at the plant \\\\\\\\nwith only 2-3 labourers present there. The NSE official called for details of \\\\\\\\nelectricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed \\\\\\\\nby Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of \\\\\\\\nDecember 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no \\\\\\\\nmanufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 28\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 26 of 29 \\\\\\\\n83. \\\\\\\\nIn another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges \\\\\\\\nthat Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to \\\\\\\\nannounce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers \\\\\\\\n(e4Ws)\u201d to Refex. As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume \\\\\\\\nGensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a \\\\\\\\ndisclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was \\\\\\\\nwithdrawn.  \\\\\\\\n84. \\\\\\\\nFurther, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed \\\\\\\\nExchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of \\\\\\\\nRs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US \\\\\\\\nSubsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary \\\\\\\\nwas incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis \\\\\\\\nof such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation \\\\\\\\n/ rationale. \\\\\\\\nPledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA \\\\\\\\n85. \\\\\\\\nAs mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol \\\\\\\\nhad come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold \\\\\\\\n1,33,48,359 shares in the Company.  \\\\\\\\n86. \\\\\\\\nWe have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that \\\\\\\\npromoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the \\\\\\\\nlatest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more \\\\\\\\npledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible \\\\\\\\nconclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, \\\\\\\\nmay be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. \\\\\\\\nPrima facie violations found against the Noticees \\\\\\\\n87. \\\\\\\\nIn the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization \\\\\\\\nand diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter \\\\\\\\ndirectors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct \\\\\\\\nbeneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above. The Company \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 29\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 27 of 29 \\\\\\\\nhas attempted to mislead SEBI, the CRAs, the lenders and the investors by \\\\\\\\nsubmitting forged Conduct Letters purportedly issued by its lenders. In view of \\\\\\\\nthese prima facie findings, the Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have violated \\\\\\\\nthe provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and \\\\\\\\nRegulations 3(b), (c) and (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(f), (k) & (r) of the SEBI (Prohibition \\\\\\\\nof Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2003.  \\\\\\\\n88. \\\\\\\\nFurther, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the \\\\\\\\npromoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of \\\\\\\\nGensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions \\\\\\\\nqualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI \\\\\\\\n(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be \\\\\\\\ndisclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol \\\\\\\\nhas allegedly failed to do. \\\\\\\\nNeed for Interim Directions \\\\\\\\n89. \\\\\\\\nWhat has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of \\\\\\\\ninternal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. \\\\\\\\nThe promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety \\\\\\\\nfirm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for \\\\\\\\nunconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. \\\\\\\\nThe result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned \\\\\\\\nabove would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, \\\\\\\\nultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company.  \\\\\\\\n90. \\\\\\\\nWhile the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) \\\\\\\\npurchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither \\\\\\\\nisolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising \\\\\\\\ncritical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector \\\\\\\\nentities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 30\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 28 of 29 \\\\\\\\nintensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and \\\\\\\\nreputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. \\\\\\\\n91. \\\\\\\\nIn the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate \\\\\\\\ngovernance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of \\\\\\\\nfunds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal \\\\\\\\ncontrol, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were \\\\\\\\nrerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol \\\\\\\\nappear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have \\\\\\\\nseamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. \\\\\\\\n92. \\\\\\\\nThe promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially \\\\\\\\nand there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the \\\\\\\\nshares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the \\\\\\\\nalleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same \\\\\\\\ntime, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or \\\\\\\\nKMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the \\\\\\\\nCompany. \\\\\\\\n93. \\\\\\\\nIt must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares \\\\\\\\nin the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At \\\\\\\\nthis stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the \\\\\\\\ninvestors.  \\\\\\\\n94. \\\\\\\\nIn view of the above, pending detailed investigation, I deem it fit to issue \\\\\\\\nimmediate interim directions to safeguard the interests of the investors and \\\\\\\\npreserve market integrity.   \\\\\\\\n95. \\\\\\\\nAt the same time, I deem it fit to caution the investors, as done on previous \\\\\\\\noccasions, to be careful while investing their savings in the capital markets. \\\\\\\\nDirections \\\\\\\\n96. \\\\\\\\nKeeping in view the foregoing, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me \\\\\\\\nunder Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B (1) read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, \\\\\\\\n1992, hereby issue by way of this interim order the following directions, which \\\\\\\\nshall be in force until further orders: - \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 31\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 29 of 29 \\\\\\\\n(a) Noticees 2 and 3 are restrained from holding the position of a director or \\\\\\\\na Key Managerial Personnel in Gensol, until further orders. \\\\\\\\n(b) Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are restrained from buying, selling or dealing in \\\\\\\\nsecurities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until \\\\\\\\nfurther orders.

The rationale for the downgrade as per the press release issued by ICRA is extracted below: *\u201cThe ratings for the bank facilities of Gensol Engineering Limited (GEL) have been* *downgraded to [ICRA]D following* ***feedback received by ICRA from the company*** ***\u2019*** ***s*** ***lenders about the ongo*** ***in*** ***g delays in debt servicing*** *.

GEL, in its latest public \\\\\\\\ndisclosures as well as in its recent communications with ICRA, had highlighted sizeable \\\\\\\\navailable liquidity to support its operations during its ongoing growth phase.\u201d \\\\\\\\n13. \\\\\\\\nICRA, in its statement also disclosed that \u201ccertain documents shared by GEL \\\\\\\\nwith ICRA, on its debt servicing track record, were apparently falsified, \\\\\\\\nwhich raises concerns on its corporate governance practices, including its \\\\\\\\nliquidity position.\u201d \\\\\\\\n14. \\\\\\\\nOn March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock \\\\\\\\nexchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the \\\\\\\\nCompany categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by \\\\\\\\nthe rating agency. \\\\\\\\n15. \\\\\\\\nSEBI called for information from the CRAs regarding the downgrade of the \\\\\\\\nratings assigned to Gensol. The CRAs submitted that pursuant to news reports \\\\\\\\nconcerning default by BluSmart Mobility Private Limited (BluSmart), a related \\\\\\\\nparty of Gensol, on February 24, 2025, the CRAs initiated a review of the ratings \\\\\\\\nassigned to the instruments of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n16. \\\\\\\\nAs per submissions of CRAs, Gensol responded to CRA queries by stating that \\\\\\\\nit was regular in its debt servicing and that the default by BluSmart had no \\\\\\\\nimpact on the Company. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 7\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 5 of 29 \\\\\\\\n17. \\\\\\\\nThe CRAs further submitted that when they sought term loan statements, \\\\\\\\nGensol provided the statements of all lenders except those of Indian \\\\\\\\nRenewable Energy Development Agency Ltd. (IREDA) and Power Finance \\\\\\\\nCorporation (PFC). In respect of these two lenders (PFC and IREDA), Gensol \\\\\\\\nshared Conduct Letters purportedly issued by IREDA and PFC, which stated \\\\\\\\nthat Gensol was regular in its debt servicing.  \\\\\\\\n18. \\\\\\\\nCARE also submitted that Gensol requested withdrawal of the ratings assigned \\\\\\\\nto it and, in support of this request, submitted a No Objection Certificate (NOC) \\\\\\\\npurportedly issued by its (Gensol) lenders.  \\\\\\\\n19. \\\\\\\\nHowever, upon seeking confirmation from IREDA and PFC regarding the \\\\\\\\nissuance of the Conduct Letters and NOCs, both the lenders categorically \\\\\\\\ndenied having issued such letters.

As per the submissions made by Gensol, EVs were procured by the \\\\\\\\nCompany and subsequently leased to BluSmart, a related party.  \\\\\\\\n26. \\\\\\\\nGensol, vide its response dated February 14, 2025, acknowledged that it had \\\\\\\\nprocured only 4,704 electric vehicles (EVs) till date, as against the 6,400 EVs \\\\\\\\nfor which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto \\\\\\\\nPrivate Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that \\\\\\\\nit sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore.  \\\\\\\\n27. \\\\\\\\nHowever, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. \\\\\\\\n663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to \\\\\\\\nprovide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total \\\\\\\\nexpected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of \\\\\\\\n6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore \\\\\\\\n(Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though \\\\\\\\nmore than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the \\\\\\\\nabove mentioned financing.  \\\\\\\\n28. \\\\\\\\nGiven the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both \\\\\\\\nthe Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed \\\\\\\\nthat once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the \\\\\\\\npurchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to \\\\\\\\nthe Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to \\\\\\\\nAnmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n29. \\\\\\\\nSome of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the \\\\\\\\npurpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal \\\\\\\\nexpenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) \\\\\\\\nbenefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close \\\\\\\\nrelatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these \\\\\\\\ndiversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and \\\\\\\\nthereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 11\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 9 of 29 \\\\\\\\nthe above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 \\\\\\\\nin the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. \\\\\\\\n30. \\\\\\\\nFor ease of reference, the details of the related parties to which fund transfers \\\\\\\\nwere observed from Go-Auto are detailed in the Table below, before explaining \\\\\\\\nthe nature of transactions entered with these entities.  \\\\\\\\nSl. \\\\\\\\nNo \\\\\\\\nRelated or Connected \\\\\\\\nentities \\\\\\\\nRelationship \\\\\\\\nDisclosed by the \\\\\\\\nCompany \\\\\\\\nas \\\\\\\\nRelated party \\\\\\\\n1. \\\\\\\\n Capbridge \\\\\\\\nVentures \\\\\\\\nLLP (Capbridge) \\\\\\\\nAnmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi are designated partners of \\\\\\\\nCapbridge. \\\\\\\\nYes \\\\\\\\n2. \\\\\\\\n Matrix \\\\\\\\nGas \\\\\\\\nand \\\\\\\\nRenewable Ltd.

On the same day, the \\\\\\\\nCompany transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another \\\\\\\\ninternal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds \\\\\\\\ncredited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. \\\\\\\\n33. \\\\\\\\nOn October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and \\\\\\\\nRetention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC \\\\\\\\nBank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. \\\\\\\\n0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go-\\\\\\\\nAuto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. \\\\\\\\n920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The \\\\\\\\nCapbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction.  \\\\\\\\n34. \\\\\\\\nOn October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore \\\\\\\\nto DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated \\\\\\\\nDecember 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for \\\\\\\\nthe purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias. The submissions \\\\\\\\nmade by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: \\\\\\\\n(a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by \\\\\\\\nJasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The \\\\\\\\nCamellias. \\\\\\\\n(b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the \\\\\\\\nconsideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. \\\\\\\\n(c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. \\\\\\\\n(d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. \\\\\\\\n(e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on \\\\\\\\nNovember 21, 2022. \\\\\\\\n35. \\\\\\\\nA pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 13\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 11 of 29 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n36. \\\\\\\\nIt can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for \\\\\\\\nprocuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a \\\\\\\\nhigh-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm \\\\\\\\nwhere the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. \\\\\\\\n37. \\\\\\\\nIt was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking \\\\\\\\nadvance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced \\\\\\\\nfrom Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to \\\\\\\\nJasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead \\\\\\\\ncredited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables \\\\\\\\nLtd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: \\\\\\\\nMovement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\nMovement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 14\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 12 of 29 \\\\\\\\n38. \\\\\\\\nBank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received \\\\\\\\nRs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which \\\\\\\\nwas partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and \\\\\\\\nanother Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be \\\\\\\\ndiverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan \\\\\\\\namounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA (Loan at Sl. No. \\\\\\\\n4 in the Table under Para 24). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to \\\\\\\\nhave been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go-\\\\\\\\nAuto on March 31, 2023.  \\\\\\\\n39. \\\\\\\\nUpon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go-\\\\\\\\nAuto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\n(a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. \\\\\\\\n68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated \\\\\\\\nFebruary 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt.

On the same day, the Company transferred Rs. 13.13 Crore to the said \\\\\\\\naccount resulting in a total fund availability of Rs. 56.82 Crore. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 15\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 13 of 29 \\\\\\\\n42. \\\\\\\\nSubsequently, on the same day (February 01, 2023) Rs. 54.62 Crore was \\\\\\\\ntransferred to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). \\\\\\\\nBefore this transaction, Go-Auto\u2019s account had a balance of Rs. 4.86 Crore. On \\\\\\\\nthe very next day (February 02, 2023), Go-Auto transferred Rs. 40 Crore to the \\\\\\\\nBank Account of Wellray (A/c No. 058605002357 with ICICI Bank), which had \\\\\\\\na balance of Rs. 4.93 Lakh before the receipt. Thereafter, on the same day, \\\\\\\\nWellray made the following outward transfers, totaling Rs. 39.50 Crore: \\\\\\\\n(a) Rs. 5.60 Crore was transferred to Matrix (Bank A/c No. 058605002549 with \\\\\\\\nICICI Bank), which it prima facie appears to have been utilized for meeting \\\\\\\\noperational expenses.  \\\\\\\\n(b) Rs. 29.50 Crore was transferred back to Gensol Engineering Limited (Bank \\\\\\\\nA/c No. 058605001635 with ICICI Bank).

Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore \\\\\\\\nout of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., \\\\\\\\n(a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi. This aspect need further examination.  \\\\\\\\n54. \\\\\\\\nFrom the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol \\\\\\\\nfrom IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis-\\\\\\\\nutilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related \\\\\\\\nentities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore \\\\\\\\n(including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis \\\\\\\\nshowed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has \\\\\\\\nobtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore.  \\\\\\\\n55. \\\\\\\\nAjay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before \\\\\\\\nSEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was \\\\\\\\ndue from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs \\\\\\\\nto Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n56. \\\\\\\\nIn this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated \\\\\\\\nApril 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore \\\\\\\\nas interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the \\\\\\\\nsame letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a \\\\\\\\npayable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. \\\\\\\\n57. \\\\\\\\nFrom the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that \\\\\\\\neven after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) \\\\\\\\nover and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to \\\\\\\\nGensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as \\\\\\\\nper the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie \\\\\\\\nappears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto \\\\\\\\nas a conduit, which needs detailed investigation.  \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 20\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 18 of 29 \\\\\\\\nDiversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd. \\\\\\\\n58. \\\\\\\\nAs stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money \\\\\\\\nborrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto. \\\\\\\\nIt was further noted during the examination that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet \\\\\\\\nSingh Jaggi\u2014current promoters and directors of Gensol\u2014were also directors \\\\\\\\nin Wellray until April 15, 2020. Further, up to the financial year 2019\u201320, the \\\\\\\\nentire shareholding in Wellray was held by Puneet Singh Jaggi and Gensol \\\\\\\\nVentures Private Limited \u2013both promoters of Gensol.  \\\\\\\\n59. \\\\\\\\nPresently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit \\\\\\\\nSolanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol \\\\\\\\nGroup until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn. Given \\\\\\\\nthe same, it is prima facie observed that Wellray is connected to Gensol, both \\\\\\\\nthrough historical promoter positions and current key managerial associations. \\\\\\\\n60. \\\\\\\\nWhen the ledgers of Wellray in the books of Gensol were examined, it was \\\\\\\\nnoted that significant sales and purchases were recorded between both \\\\\\\\ncompanies in FY 23 and FY24, the details of which are given in the Table below: \\\\\\\\nParticulars \\\\\\\\nFY 23 \\\\\\\\n(Rs. In \\\\\\\\nCrores) \\\\\\\\nFY 24 \\\\\\\\n(Rs. In \\\\\\\\nCrores) \\\\\\\\nTotal Purchases and Expenses booked by Gensol against Wellray \\\\\\\\n66.98 \\\\\\\\n71.55 \\\\\\\\nTotal Sales and Income booked by Gensol against Wellray \\\\\\\\n6.03 \\\\\\\\n6.10 \\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\n61. \\\\\\\\nIt was also noted that Wellray had made an investment in Gensol and was a \\\\\\\\ndisclosed public shareholder of Gensol. A snapshot of the financial position of \\\\\\\\nWellray is also given below: \\\\\\\\nParticulars \\\\\\\\nFY20 (Rs. In \\\\\\\\nCrores) \\\\\\\\nFY 21 (Rs. \\\\\\\\nIn Crores) \\\\\\\\nFY 22 (Rs. \\\\\\\\nIn Crores) \\\\\\\\nFY 23 (Rs.

The prima facie findings is the said examination is detailed \\\\\\\\nbelow: \\\\\\\\n65. \\\\\\\\nUpon review of the bank statements of Wellray\u2019s account (A/c No. \\\\\\\\n058605002357 with ICICI Bank), it was observed that out of the amount of Rs. \\\\\\\\n424.14 Crore received from Gensol, as mentioned in para 63 above, Rs. 382.84 \\\\\\\\nCrore was transferred by Wellray to various other entities.

As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of \\\\\\\\nGensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions.  \\\\\\\\nDisclosures made by the Company \\\\\\\\n80. \\\\\\\\nIt was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, \\\\\\\\nto the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly \\\\\\\\nlaunched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. \\\\\\\\nHowever, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and \\\\\\\\nexamined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of \\\\\\\\nUnderstandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs \\\\\\\\nwere in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price \\\\\\\\nof the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the \\\\\\\\nCompany was making misleading disclosures to investors.  \\\\\\\\n81. \\\\\\\\nIn this regard, representative of NSE visited the plant site of Gensol Electric \\\\\\\\nVehicle Private Limited located at Gat No. 877, Next to Mahindra Towers, Khed, \\\\\\\\nNighoje, Chakan, Pune \u2013 410501 on April 09, 2025.  \\\\\\\\n82. \\\\\\\\nIt was found during the visit that there was no manufacturing activity at the plant \\\\\\\\nwith only 2-3 labourers present there. The NSE official called for details of \\\\\\\\nelectricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed \\\\\\\\nby Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of \\\\\\\\nDecember 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no \\\\\\\\nmanufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 28\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 26 of 29 \\\\\\\\n83. \\\\\\\\nIn another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges \\\\\\\\nthat Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to \\\\\\\\nannounce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers \\\\\\\\n(e4Ws)\u201d to Refex. As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume \\\\\\\\nGensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a \\\\\\\\ndisclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was \\\\\\\\nwithdrawn.  \\\\\\\\n84. \\\\\\\\nFurther, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed \\\\\\\\nExchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of \\\\\\\\nRs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US \\\\\\\\nSubsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary \\\\\\\\nwas incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis \\\\\\\\nof such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation \\\\\\\\n/ rationale. \\\\\\\\nPledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA \\\\\\\\n85. \\\\\\\\nAs mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol \\\\\\\\nhad come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold \\\\\\\\n1,33,48,359 shares in the Company.  \\\\\\\\n86. \\\\\\\\nWe have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that \\\\\\\\npromoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the \\\\\\\\nlatest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more \\\\\\\\npledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible \\\\\\\\nconclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, \\\\\\\\nmay be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh \\\\\\\\nJaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. \\\\\\\\nPrima facie violations found against the Noticees \\\\\\\\n87. \\\\\\\\nIn the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization \\\\\\\\nand diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter \\\\\\\\ndirectors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct \\\\\\\\nbeneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above. The Company \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 29\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 27 of 29 \\\\\\\\nhas attempted to mislead SEBI, the CRAs, the lenders and the investors by \\\\\\\\nsubmitting forged Conduct Letters purportedly issued by its lenders. In view of \\\\\\\\nthese prima facie findings, the Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have violated \\\\\\\\nthe provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and \\\\\\\\nRegulations 3(b), (c) and (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(f), (k) & (r) of the SEBI (Prohibition \\\\\\\\nof Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2003.  \\\\\\\\n88. \\\\\\\\nFurther, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the \\\\\\\\npromoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of \\\\\\\\nGensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions \\\\\\\\nqualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI \\\\\\\\n(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be \\\\\\\\ndisclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR \\\\\\\\nRegulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol \\\\\\\\nhas allegedly failed to do. \\\\\\\\nNeed for Interim Directions \\\\\\\\n89. \\\\\\\\nWhat has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of \\\\\\\\ninternal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. \\\\\\\\nThe promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety \\\\\\\\nfirm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for \\\\\\\\nunconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. \\\\\\\\nThe result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned \\\\\\\\nabove would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, \\\\\\\\nultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company.  \\\\\\\\n90. \\\\\\\\nWhile the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) \\\\\\\\npurchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither \\\\\\\\nisolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising \\\\\\\\ncritical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector \\\\\\\\nentities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital-\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 30\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 28 of 29 \\\\\\\\nintensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and \\\\\\\\nreputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. \\\\\\\\n91. \\\\\\\\nIn the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate \\\\\\\\ngovernance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of \\\\\\\\nfunds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal \\\\\\\\ncontrol, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were \\\\\\\\nrerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol \\\\\\\\nappear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have \\\\\\\\nseamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. \\\\\\\\n92. \\\\\\\\nThe promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially \\\\\\\\nand there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the \\\\\\\\nshares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the \\\\\\\\nalleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same \\\\\\\\ntime, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or \\\\\\\\nKMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the \\\\\\\\nCompany. \\\\\\\\n93. \\\\\\\\nIt must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares \\\\\\\\nin the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At \\\\\\\\nthis stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the \\\\\\\\ninvestors.  \\\\\\\\n94. \\\\\\\\nIn view of the above, pending detailed investigation, I deem it fit to issue \\\\\\\\nimmediate interim directions to safeguard the interests of the investors and \\\\\\\\npreserve market integrity.   \\\\\\\\n95. \\\\\\\\nAt the same time, I deem it fit to caution the investors, as done on previous \\\\\\\\noccasions, to be careful while investing their savings in the capital markets. \\\\\\\\nDirections \\\\\\\\n96. \\\\\\\\nKeeping in view the foregoing, I, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me \\\\\\\\nunder Sections 11, 11(4) and 11B (1) read with Section 19 of the SEBI Act, \\\\\\\\n1992, hereby issue by way of this interim order the following directions, which \\\\\\\\nshall be in force until further orders: - \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n---\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page 31\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n___________________________________________________________________________ \\\\\\\\nInterim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited                               Page 29 of 29 \\\\\\\\n(a) Noticees 2 and 3 are restrained from holding the position of a director or \\\\\\\\na Key Managerial Personnel in Gensol, until further orders. \\\\\\\\n(b) Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are restrained from buying, selling or dealing in \\\\\\\\nsecurities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until \\\\\\\\nfurther orders. If the said Noticees have any open position in any \\\\\\\\nexchange-traded derivative contracts, as on the date of the Order, they \\\\\\\\ncan close out /square off such open positions within 7 days from the date \\\\\\\\nof the Order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier. The \\\\\\\\nNoticees are permitted to settle the pay-in and pay-out obligations in \\\\\\\\nrespect of transactions, if any, which have taken place before the close of \\\\\\\\ntrading on the date of this Order. \\\\\\\\n(c) \\\\\\\\nNoticee 1 is directed to put on hold the stock split announced by it. \\\\\\\\n(d) SEBI shall appoint a forensic auditor to examine the books of accounts of \\\\\\\\nGensol and its related parties. \\\\\\\\n97. \\\\\\\\nThe forensic auditor/ audit firm so appointed as per this Order shall submit a \\\\\\\\nReport to SEBI within six months from the date of appointment.  \\\\\\\\n98. \\\\\\\\nThe foregoing prima facie observations contained in this Order are made on the \\\\\\\\nbasis of the material available on record.

On March 05, 2024, Gensol issued an investor release through the stock exchange platform, signed by its CEO, Anmol Singh Jaggi, wherein the Company categorically denied \u201cany involvement in falsification claims\u201d made by the rating agency.\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_2]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='related party by GEL).| |Make my trip|3,00,000|Appears to be for personal use| |Ali Imran Naqvi|1,50,000|Executive Director at GEL| |Total|25,16,05,066|| ***Utilization of funds by Puneet Singh Jaggi*** ### 69.
