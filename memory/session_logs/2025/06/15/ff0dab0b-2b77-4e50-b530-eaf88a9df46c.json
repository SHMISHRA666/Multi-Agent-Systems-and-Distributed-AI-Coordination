The disclosure made by Gensol in its annual report for FY 2023, in respect of this loan is given below: **Image:** (g) Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) Rupee term loan of Rs. 1,43,00,000/- carries interest @ 9.95% p.a. The loan is repayable in 20 quarterly installments plus interest thereon and repayment starting from June 1, 2023 of Rs. 1,78,500/- each for first 4 installments, Rs. 3,57,05,000/- each for next \u201c5-12\u201d installment and Rs. 4,96,31,250/- each for \u201c13-20\u201d installment. The above loan is secured against hypothecation of 400 EV cars. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 9 of 29** ----- ### 32. On September 30, 2022, Gensol received a disbursement of Rs. 71.39 Crore from IREDA in its \u201c GEL Trust and Retention Account IREDA Limited\u201d (Bank A/c No. 922020025290861) maintained with Axis Bank. On the same day, the Company transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another internal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go- Auto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias . The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias . (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. (c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. (d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. (e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on November 21, 2022. 35. A pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 10 of 29** ----- **Image:** GEL TRUST AND RETENTION ACCOUNT IREDALIMITED Rs 93.88 crore 03/10/2022\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_6]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

Upon tracing the source of funds, it was noted that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi had transferred Rs. 10.07 Crore to Gensol Ventures Private Limited on September 26, 2022. Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, had, prior to the said transfer, received funds from Wellray in the following manner: |Entity Name|Account No.|Balance before receipt of funds from Wellray (Rs.)|Amount received from Wellray (Rs.)| |---|---|---|---| |Anmol Singh Jaggi|004301520339 ICICI Bank|65.45 Lakh|5 Crore| |Puneet Singh Jaggi|004301532231 (ICICI Bank)|3.06 Lakh|5 Crore| ### 73. Further, on the same day, Wellray received funds amounting to Rs. 10 Crore from Gensol in A/c. No. 058605002357 with ICICI Bank. The balance in the said bank account of Wellray prior to this transfer was Rs. 8,81,783/-. 74.

The above loan is secured against hypothecation of 400 EV cars. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 9 of 29** ----- ### 32. On September 30, 2022, Gensol received a disbursement of Rs. 71.39 Crore from IREDA in its \u201c GEL Trust and Retention Account IREDA Limited\u201d (Bank A/c No. 922020025290861) maintained with Axis Bank. On the same day, the Company transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another internal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go- Auto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias . The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias . (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. (c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. (d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. (e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on November 21, 2022. 35. A pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 10 of 29** ----- **Image:** GEL TRUST AND RETENTION ACCOUNT IREDALIMITED Rs 93.88 crore 03/10/2022\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_6]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

Upon tracing the source of funds, it was noted that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi had transferred Rs. 10.07 Crore to Gensol Ventures Private Limited on September 26, 2022. Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, had, prior to the said transfer, received funds from Wellray in the following manner: |Entity Name|Account No.|Balance before receipt of funds from Wellray (Rs.)|Amount received from Wellray (Rs.)| |---|---|---|---| |Anmol Singh Jaggi|004301520339 ICICI Bank|65.45 Lakh|5 Crore| |Puneet Singh Jaggi|004301532231 (ICICI Bank)|3.06 Lakh|5 Crore| ### 73. Further, on the same day, Wellray received funds amounting to Rs. 10 Crore from Gensol in A/c. No. 058605002357 with ICICI Bank. The balance in the said bank account of Wellray prior to this transfer was Rs. 8,81,783/-. 74.
