Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

The Company\u2019s objective is to create long-term sustainable value for all the stakeholders associated with its business, including investors, employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, Government and communities. To this end, it is vital for DLF to develop an understanding of the stakeholders\u2019 needs, concerns and expectations. DLF strives to achieve this through effective collaboration and regular interaction with all its key stakeholder groups. The process of stakeholder engagement at DLF is decentralized and respective departments are responsible for engaging with internal and external stakeholders associated with their functions.

Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94.

The Company\u2019s objective is to create long-term sustainable value for all the stakeholders associated with its business, including investors, employees, customers, suppliers and business partners, Government and communities. To this end, it is vital for DLF to develop an understanding of the stakeholders\u2019 needs, concerns and expectations. DLF strives to achieve this through effective collaboration and regular interaction with all its key stakeholder groups. The process of stakeholder engagement at DLF is decentralized and respective departments are responsible for engaging with internal and external stakeholders associated with their functions. However, DLF\u2019s approach to stakeholder engagement is governed by its Stakeholder Engagement Policy, which provides guidelines for identifying key stakeholder groups across the organization, as those individuals, groups of individuals and/ or organisations: - that are directly or indirectly dependent on DLF\u2019s activities, its real estate portfolio or services and associated performance, or on whom DLF is dependent in order to operate; - to whom DLF has or in the future may have, legal, commercial, operational or moral responsibilities; and - who can influence or have impact on DLF\u2019s strategic or operational decision making. **2.** **List stakeholder groups identified as key for your entity and the frequency of engagement with each** **stakeholder group.** |Stakeholder Group|Whether identified as Vulnerable & Marginalized Group (Y/ N)|Channels of communication (E-mail, SMS, Newspaper, Pamphlets, Advertisement, Community Meetings, Notice Board, Website), Other|Frequency of engagement (Annually/ Half yearly/ Quarterly/ others)|Purpose and scope of engagement including key Topics and Concerns raised during such engagement| |---|---|---|---|---| |Customers|No|\u2022 E-mails \u2022 Direct customer calls \u2022 Advertisements \u2022 Press calls through empaneled channel partners \u2022 Customer satisfaction surveys \u2022 Training sessions for tenants occupying DLF\u2019s properties|Ongoing|\u2022 Product launch awareness;
