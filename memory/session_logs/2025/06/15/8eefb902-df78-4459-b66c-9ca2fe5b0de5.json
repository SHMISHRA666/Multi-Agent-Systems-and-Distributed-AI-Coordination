These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles\u2019. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.

Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='property - strategy - as - pr/ 26 ----- ## talented engineers.\u2019 [95] He hopes that his open source stratagem will enable him to compete with the big automobile manufacturers.

[100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019 [102] He observed that \u2018even worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019 [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='the study of international law, intellectual property, and climate change.

Gigafactory ** In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

[ 22] ## The company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles\u2019. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas.

Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='property - strategy - as - pr/ 26 ----- ## talented engineers.\u2019 [95] He hopes that his open source stratagem will enable him to compete with the big automobile manufacturers.

[100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019 [102] He observed that \u2018even worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019 [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_13]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='the study of international law, intellectual property, and climate change.

Gigafactory ** In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.
