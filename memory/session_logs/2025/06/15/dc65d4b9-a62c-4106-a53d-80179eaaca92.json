No. 9. \\\\x07Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\\\\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]\\' annotations=None', \"type='text' text='acquired based on traditional knowledge. |S.

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.

No. 9. \\\\x07Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\\\\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\\\\\'markitdown[all]\\\\\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\\\\\'packages/markitdown[all]\\\\\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats.
