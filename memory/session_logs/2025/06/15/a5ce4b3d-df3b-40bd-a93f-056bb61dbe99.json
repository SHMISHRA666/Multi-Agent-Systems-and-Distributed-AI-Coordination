He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] ## Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019. [107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 ----- ## vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_14]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] ## Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.\u2019 [13] Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u2019 [14] This statement has attracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual property; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address climate change. 10 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 11 Ibid, 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 5 ----- ## This paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual property, open innovation, and climate change. It is worth situating the story in the context of the growing literature on intellectual property and clean technologies. Professor Peter Menell from the University of California, Berkeley, and Sarah Tran reviewed the canon of key articles in the field in Intellectual Property, Innovation, and the Environment . [ 15] Scottish scholar Abbe Brown has edited a number of contemporary papers on intellectual property and climate change.

[87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

The announcement by Tesla Motors also promoted a wider discussion about economics, business, and innovation in respect of the automobile industry. Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, \u2018It is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.\u2019 [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: \u2018Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world\u2019s most 94 Joshua Gans, \u2018Intellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations\u2019, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\' annotations=None']",

He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] ## Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019. [107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 ----- ## vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_14]' annotations=None\", \"type='text' text='been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] ## Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal.\u2019 [13] Elon Musk promised: \u2018Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.\u2019 [14] This statement has attracted a wide range of interest, because it raises important issues in respect of intellectual property; open source strategies; business; and innovation in clean technologies to address climate change. 10 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 11 Ibid, 12 Ibid. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 5 ----- ## This paper will consider Tesla Motors, and evaluate its statements in respect of intellectual property, open innovation, and climate change.

[87] He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 ----- ## the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25 ----- ## **3.

Professor Joshua Gans, an economist from the University of Toronto, commented, \u2018It is 448 words that I believe (despite its length) may well become the Gettysburg Address for entrepreneurship and innovation.\u2019 [94] In his address, Elon Musk emphasized: \u2018Technology leadership is not defined by patents, which history has repeatedly shown to be small protection indeed against a determined competitor, but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world\u2019s most 94 Joshua Gans, \u2018Intellectual Property Strategy as Public Relations\u2019, Digitopoly, 12 June 2014, http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/12/intellectual -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_12]\\' annotations=None']",
