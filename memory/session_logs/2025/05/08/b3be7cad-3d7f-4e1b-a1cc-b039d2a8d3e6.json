For the corresponding period (FY 2017 to H1 of FY 2025), the balance sheet of the Company recorded an equally impressive growth. The total liabilities/balance sheet size expanded from Rs. 10 Crore in FY 2017 to Rs. 2,202 Crore in the first half of FY 2025. During this period, Gensol\u2019s borrowings increased from Nil in FY 2017 to Rs. 1,045 Crore in the first half of FY 2025, after touching Rs. 1,260 Crore in FY 2024. 5.

From the above, it is noted that Wellray predominately traded in the scrip of Gensol Engineering Limited (99% of total trade value) during the period April 2022 to December 2024. The month wise breakup of the value of trades executed in the scrip of Gensol by Wellray is given in the Table below: |Year|Month|GENSOL ENGINEERING LIMITED|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |||BUY VALUE (Rs.)|SELL VALUE (Rs.)| |2022|Nov|2,21,56,090|-| ||Dec|98,37,733|-| |2023|Jan|2,32,55,449|-| ||Feb|3,20,02,357|-| ||Mar|9,27,69,605|2,56,72,230| ||Apr|14,23,72,696|-| ||May|7,78,22,780|-| ||Jun|4,82,72,008|30,76,176| ||Jul|1,97,70,884|48,89,70,887| ||Aug|-|9,96,60,761| ||Nov|14,95,44,688|-| ||Dec|48,60,180|11,78,96,384| |2024|Jan|1,49,32,076|-| ||Feb|3,84,62,148|5,63,63,679| ||Mar|4,60,31,549|3,57,94,628| ||Apr|8,66,53,854|3,88,85,000| ||May|6,11,02,180|-| ||Jun|20,95,86,297|14,23,00,844| ||Jul|7,91,53,950|36,82,94,973| ||Aug|10,09,789|35,93,48,082| ||Oct|4,55,09,012|-| ||Nov|-|4,81,65,000| |Total||1,60,51,05,325|1,78,44,28,644| 78. It was noted from the analysis of the bank statements of Wellray that out of the Rs. 137.57 Crore cumulatively transferred by Wellray to the stockbroker Sharekhan till March 2024, Rs. 101.35 Crore was received from Gensol and its related parties.

In view of the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. ***Disclosures made by the Company*** ### 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the Company was making misleading disclosures to investors. 81.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles\u2019. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.

Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]', annotations=None)] isError=False",

From the above, it is noted that Wellray predominately traded in the scrip of Gensol Engineering Limited (99% of total trade value) during the period April 2022 to December 2024. The month wise breakup of the value of trades executed in the scrip of Gensol by Wellray is given in the Table below: |Year|Month|GENSOL ENGINEERING LIMITED|Col4| |---|---|---|---| |||BUY VALUE (Rs.)|SELL VALUE (Rs.)| |2022|Nov|2,21,56,090|-| ||Dec|98,37,733|-| |2023|Jan|2,32,55,449|-| ||Feb|3,20,02,357|-| ||Mar|9,27,69,605|2,56,72,230| ||Apr|14,23,72,696|-| ||May|7,78,22,780|-| ||Jun|4,82,72,008|30,76,176| ||Jul|1,97,70,884|48,89,70,887| ||Aug|-|9,96,60,761| ||Nov|14,95,44,688|-| ||Dec|48,60,180|11,78,96,384| |2024|Jan|1,49,32,076|-| ||Feb|3,84,62,148|5,63,63,679| ||Mar|4,60,31,549|3,57,94,628| ||Apr|8,66,53,854|3,88,85,000| ||May|6,11,02,180|-| ||Jun|20,95,86,297|14,23,00,844| ||Jul|7,91,53,950|36,82,94,973| ||Aug|10,09,789|35,93,48,082| ||Oct|4,55,09,012|-| ||Nov|-|4,81,65,000| |Total||1,60,51,05,325|1,78,44,28,644| 78. It was noted from the analysis of the bank statements of Wellray that out of the Rs. 137.57 Crore cumulatively transferred by Wellray to the stockbroker Sharekhan till March 2024, Rs. 101.35 Crore was received from Gensol and its related parties. A party-wise breakup of these inflows is provided below: |Col1|Col2|Col3|Rs.

In view of the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. ***Disclosures made by the Company*** ### 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the Company was making misleading disclosures to investors. 81.

Second, the paper explores Tesla Motors\u2019 embrace of an open source philosophy. Third, it analyses the larger issues about business development. Fourth, the paper examines Tesla Motors\u2019 use of trade mark law and related rights in its marketing and branding. Fifth, this paper concludes by considering Tesla Motors in light of larger initiatives in respect of clean technologies, renewable energy and climate change. Of particular note is sustainable transportation; the development of a Gigafactory; and Elon Musk\u2019s complementary work at SolarCity in promoting solar technologies. 1.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] ## The company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles\u2019. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.

Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. [ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_4]', annotations=None)] isError=False",
